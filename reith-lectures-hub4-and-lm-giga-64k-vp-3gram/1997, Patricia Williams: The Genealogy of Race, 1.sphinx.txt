this is a cold carlos from the odd coates of the b. b. c. to east lake chairs this select chat to cease the genealogy of grace didn't like patricia williams was originally brought caustic in nineteen ninety seven mice and attends a smaller ski school over the past year to three different teachers because school but short mayhew is color blind writ in the second houses and took my son to an awful lot just to test him and pronounced his vision perfect i could not figure out what was going on but i began to listen carefully to what he was saying about color as it turned out ice and did not miss identify color he resisted identifying color at all i don't know he would say when asked what color the grass was how or most bitterly it makes no difference that latter this assertion of the greenest grass making no difference was such a precocious cleese cynical record that began to suspect some social complication in which he was somehow invested a lot of the shortage of the two well meaning teachers is predominantly white school had valiantly and repeated clique short their churches that kollar makes no difference does it matter they told the children what they york lack or white or red or green or blue yet a further investigation of the very reason that the teachers had felt it necessary to practice what it in the first place was that it didn't matter and and predictably cruel ways some of the children had been fighting about whether black people could play good ice bison anxious response was redefined by his teachers as physical deficiencies this anxiety british scientist efficiency suggests to me that maybe illustrative of the way in which the literal ideal of color blindness is too often confounded that is to say the very notion of blindness about color constitutes an ideological confusion at best and denial did sperry first i'd recognize are linked to the teachers were inspired by a desire to make a whole a division in the racks but there is much overlooked an unmoved and do that which clearly can unfortunately matters just by illegally and that which makes no difference to dismiss this as however unintentional believes those in my son's position pooled a tree in the car seat of their own experience and the often alienating terms in which they must seek social accepted this alliance that the world right now someone has just announced in no uncertain terms that they hate you because your dark but say it or catholic coral one or the right height and panicked authority figures try to patch things up by reassuring you catch that race or gender or stature or your heartfelt religion doesn't matter if it means nothing in the calculation of your humanity is the most insignificant little bottle of beans in the world but do want to underscore that i do embrace color blindness as a legitimate hope for the future i worry that we tend to enshrine the notion with a kind of utopian isn't whose naive tate will sure it's dismissed in the material world ranging from playgrounds to politics are ideals perhaps need more thoughtful albeit more complicated guardianship when i referred to a more complicated guardianship i. means something or the n. b. i. think therefore it is the school of idealism i don't think about color and therefore your problems don't exist if only it were so easy if indeed it not that easy and application of such quick fixes becomes not just a short cut to short circuit in the process of resolution in the example of what some school experience the collective reversion to confronting the social tensions he faced resulted in their being apologized as his individual physical limitation this is a phenomenon that happens all too sickly to children of color in a variety of contexts in both us and the feud came the disproportionate numbers of black children who end up in special education or were written off as failures to attest to the degree to which this is a profound source of social anxiety in addition the failure to deal straightforwardly with the pervasive practices of exclusion that infect evened the very young allowed by some as white schoolmates to endorse a default electric prematurely imagined community but sammy in the week and all the low rather too easily into this house congratulatory stances preached universal isn't already are in the world we are the children was the evocative full throat harmony of a few years ago yet nowhere has that been invoked more passionately than in the face of tidal waves of dissension and even as the children learned that we children are not like those the benighted creatures on the other side of the pale this tension between material conditions and what one is culture to steed or not see the dilemma of the emperor's new clothes women ,comma it's

security achieved through ignorance ours must be a world in which we know each other better to put it another way it is a dangerous if comprehensible temptation to imagine inclusiveness by magic in a

of global seems less this blinding rather than just color blind this dilemma being collared circus speak in a world of norma to whiteness whiteness being defined as the abs and a collar that drive

must customs convention is to coat the inside ancient wisdom the habits of racial slot in western society just as surely encapsulate some of the greatest stakes in human history so i would do we rethink this most kabul subdivisions to fox lined in our body politic of false line in ourselves the ability to remain true to oneself seems to me to be not just an ultimate goal of our political and social aspirations but must begin with the ethical project considering how we cannot align ostensible ourselves with this sense of the world this is the essence of integrity is not never having to split the country will maintain a front in a closely guarded inside creating community in other words involves this most difficult work of negotiating real divisions of consider during boundaries before we go crashing through and pondering their differences before we can ever agree on the terms of our sameness for the discounted edition of the emperor's new clothes or a little boy's collar is already the description of corrupted community perhaps one reason that conversations about race or softened due to frustration is that the notion of whiteness as race is almost never implicated one of the more difficult legacy since slavery and colonialism is the degree to which racism skirmishes hold is manifested not merely in the divided demographics of neighborhood art education or class but also in the process of what media expert john says call's became ex nomination of white dust as racial identity whiteness is unnamed suppressed beyond the realm of a trace nomination permits whites to entertain the notion that race leaders over their current in the other side of the tracks in black bodies and inner city neighborhoods can cast a dark netherworld where whites are not involved at this level the creation of a sense of community is a lifelong negotiation left analysts saw the one morning when my son was three at the country's preschool but and ran straight copilot lego and proceeded to work i crossed the crewman twitches lunch box and refrigerator where i encountered a little girl sitting at table beating a mound of clay into submission with the plastic rolling pin ice yamani chee said to be cheerfully that must mean you're a boy is here somewhere to get heat here unanswered spinning house retreat for kosher she was the year he's overpaid a leg up she strained to see around the bookcases and yet she said now all i see that black faces his i walked away without responding in enraged and how can one be so in reached an innocent child yet not knowing what to say just then rushing to get the jacket the dangerous broken glass at my motions out of the forum i remember being three so well three was the age when i learned is that i was black but college kid on key child different what made me so angry and were dressed in a counter for eighty years later it was the realization that not muffle white children who taught me to see my blackness as a mark probably ever learned to see themselves as white in that our culture whiteness is clearly marked in the intake of beer in their sense of why directed blackness and that image are terry and privilege ,comma never noticing oneself was the beginning of an unbalanced for which so much so much else flowed but that is hard to talk about even now is inside acquired before i had the words to sort it out yet is imperative to think about this phenomenon of assisting race which i believe is a good deal more widespread than these small examples in a sense race matters are resented in the press in much the same way as matters of sex and scandal this subject is considered a route and transcripts of one in mixed company in matters observation is sometimes inevitable but about which once seemed little should be heard nonetheless praised this tends to be treated as though it were an especially delicate category of social conformity to call the like extreme obesity or disfigurement every parent knows

and ethical dilemma in that moment i was fishing in restraint by social niceties on the one hand we rushed to place a limit on what can be said to strangers and what must be withheld for fear of indecision or hurting someone's feelings as members of the drug's cite the respect one another by starting not to inflict every last intimate prying curiosity we may harbor up and everyone we meet that said there remains the problem of how or whether we'd ever answered the question and that is a dimension of the state and u. that is considerably more troubling why it is that man wearing no

questions overall begins to grow around the fourteen gates for we all know and children are best of all when someone wants to change the subject and prepares for its own child is left to the monstrous creativity of the ignorance and wild imagination can i do believe that this unfortunate negotiation of social difference as much in common with discussions about race raised is treated as though it

paralysis in the face of the far end and the anxiety producing it is as though we're all skating across the pond this not quite thoroughly frozen two centuries ago are perhaps only a few decades ago blake was solidly frozen and if it is skating across the surface things seemed much more secure it was a much more dismal loss to put those two states were frozen at the bottom of the palm overtime to wear a brace relations is warmed somewhat and some few of those at the bottom have found their way to the surface we no longer hold our breath and lead even learned to skate the noise the racial chasm

conviction that talking about it will only make things worse as a racial divide is exacerbated further by a welter of localized utter callous foolishly around the edges of our most demanding social stresses black people happy people if they would just stop complaint alleged that they would see how happy they are black people who say they are happy our leftist agitators whose time would be better spent looking for a real job white people are victims pork bangladeshis are poor because they want to be up for white people are poor because rich indians stole all the jobs with the risk of it for inaction there is no racism in the marketplace each according to his marriage goes the can't even as the commission for racial equality receives seventeen hundred formal complaints a month of racial

of the men's hockey wearing masks the women hailed him as singing each gear ,comma this year it's on some level everyone must know that these are not spirits but husbands and brothers and fathers and sons habits so powerful is the ritual to the sense of community that it is up in pain and death to the women failed to become u. s. spirits are kosher i think that the power of grace resembles just such a public secret i understand the civic ritual decreed choirs us to say in the face of all our differences we are all on we are the world i understand the need for the publicly breeze or a good faith in public ideals as binding and is gaining community such beliefs are the very foundation of the institutional legitimacy and no society can hold off together without them yet such binding force comes from a discreet willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of honoring the spiritual power of our appointed ideals shot and where suspicion cynicism and betrayal defeat in a way to communicate to

exacted even as those historical disruptions continued to scar contemporary social arrangements with the trend and didn't urgency of their hand me down cree i realized there for that might be considered impertinent to keep raising the ghost of slavery triangle trade in waving it around there is a pronounced preference in polite sanity or just letting bygones be blackhawks at need them more optimistic enterprise might be to begin any contemporary analysis of grace with the civil rights movement in the united states or the nodding of riots in the united kingdom beginning at those points is a way of focusing once you've been confining ones reference to legitimately inspiring ideals that coalesced those movements the aims of colorblind s. equality of all people at the possibility of peace full coexistence if that were well chosen temporal slice allows us to be optimistic about the possibility of progress there nonetheless limitations to such a frame first is the conceptual preach history of those who once explained the toll of racism and klingon effects it can be no adequate explanation without reference to u. secondly the diets or complexity of today's social problems requires an analysis that moves those ideals of the social movements of the nineteen sixties and seventies beyond themselves into the present into the future to a more complex political grappling with

but the nation's state its self at the lead to genuine longterm optimism about the future of race relations depend on a foul excavation of the same in memory slips into my mind i was writing from new york to washington d. c. some years ago i was on my list ,comma where scott is rather i was a comedy by two black colleagues an hour into the trip the train stopped in the city of philadelphia a young white woman got on my colleagues knew a she was also a lawyer headed to the same conference that she join desk sitting among us can double row of seats it faced each other a while later the conductor came along the new one and held up for a ticket but the conductor did not seem to see her he saw four of a seated at only three taken steps one and he hasn't played a key said daring at me that each of my two black friends are never twenty to the white woman and someone else said over their but the conductor was as a which lie view hasn't paid he asked again tillis kept saying i received the and a white woman speaking very clearly said here i ache and trying to give you might take it the conductor was skyline the conductor still did not hear i am not moving to one if you pay is up it was the longest time before the conductor stopped staring and all peron directions it was the longest tying before he heard the new woman pressing her to pick up on him or hoist reaching him finally as though from a great distance passing through light years of understanding as though from another universe and the realization that finding that his face was like the dawning of the great surprise how precisely the issue of color remains so powerfully determinant of the everything from light circumstance to manner of death in a world is by and large officially colorblind how what metaphors mass hierarchy that make racial domination frequently seem so natural soap indivisible indeed so attractive how it is racist and continue to evolve post late pre and post quality legislation across such geographic temporal and political distance know what i i am not saying that this is the first times but neither will i can see that this is the best of all possible worlds and what could the theme is that not to try to match and how much better he could be i had a dream that might on the other morning any cost no lease said it was more of a miracle you know what a miracle is tell me if i said under struck in a breakfast with maternal box in their court is where you have a dream and you open your eyes and it's when you wake up in your dream is all around you is a pretty good definition i thought and even though my son is a miracle had something to do with pirates meeting dinosaurs have i do think that to a very great extent we dream of our world into the fund are worse our customs and lost our culture and society are sustained by the myths we embrace the stories we circulate explained what we bottled it leaves the grace isms hardy persistence and demands adaptability are sustained by habit of human imagination deflected rhetoric and hidden license i'd leave no less than optimistic course might be chartered if only we could imagine it where world it would be if we could all wake up and see off ourselves reflected in the world not merely in a territorial and go with the kind of not exclusive entitlement that grants not so much possession as investment it acutely anachronistic
