this is about cost and the talk i said that b. b. c. to take tests to sanction the series and my aim is the brains and signed skip them by tell sell was rich in april ,comma asked in nineteen eighty full we feel perfectly confident in saying things like bad though noted for their stories because he likes mrs. thatcher's handling of the falklands affair that we have no idea how i go about saying things like that all voted for the tories because of a condition of his type of salomon's daddy is we have common sense explanations of people's behavior in mantle's terms in terms of their desires wishes the years hopes and sought and we suppose that there must also be a narrow physiological sort of explanation of people's bader in terms of process is in their brains that trouble is that the first of these sorts of explanations works well enough in practice but is not scientific or as the second is certainly scientific but we have no idea how to make you work in practice now battle leaves as apparently with a gap a gap between membrane of the mind and some of the greatest intellectual efforts of the twentieth century have been attempts to fill this gap to get a science of human behavior which was not just common sense grandmother psychology but was not scientific marrow physiology either opt about present time without exception they gap filling efforts have been failures behavior ism is the most spectacular failure but in my lifetime i have lived through exaggerated claims made on behalf of an eventually disappointed by a game's theories seibert headaches information theory struck truism socio biology at a bunch of others to anticipate a bit i'm going to claim that all a gap filling efforts failed because there isn't any gap to fill the most recent gap filling efforts or allow ion analogies between human beings and digital computers on the most extreme version of this view which i call strong artificial intelligence or just strong ai the brain is a digital computer at the mine is just a computer program now that's the view i refute it last week the latest attempt to fill the gap is often called cognitive issam because it derives from work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence and informs the mainstream of a new discipline of cognitive science like strong ai he sees the computer is the right picture of a mind and not just as a metaphor but ,comma like strong and hide it does not work at least a dozen half to claim that computers literally have thoughts and feelings if one had to summarize the research program of cognitive izumi would look like this sinking is processing information but information processing is just simple manipulation computers do simple manipulation so the best way to steady sinking or as they prefer a college cognition is the steady computational symbol manipulating programs whether they are in computers or in brains and su dan that task of cognitive science used to characterize the brain not at the level of nerve cells nor at the level of conscious mental states but rather at the level of its functioning as an information processing system and that's where the gap and gets feel now i really can exaggerate extent to which this research program has seemed to constitute a major breakthrough in the science of the mind indeed according to its supporters it might even be the breakthrough that will at last place psychology on a secure scientific footing now than it has freed itself from the delusions of behavior is i'm going to attack cognitive ism inez lecture but i want to begin by illustrating its attractiveness we know that there is a level of naive commonsense grandmother psychology and also a level of narrow physiology at the level of neurons in oran modules and sin apps isn't oro transmitters in bhutto's in all the rest of so why would anyone supposed that between these two levels as also a level of mental processes which are computational processes envied why would anyone suppose that it's a fact level that the brain performs those functions a we regard as essential to the survival of the organism namely the functions of information processing when all are several reasons forced a halt many mention one which is somewhat disreputable but icing is actually quite influential because we don't understand the brain very well where constantly tempted to use the latest technology as a model for trying to understand that in my childhood we were always assured that the brain was that telephone switchboard what else could it be that i was amused to see that sharing denigrate british marrow scientist thought that the brain work like that telegraph system freud often compared the brain hydraulic and electromagnetic systems whiteness compared it to a male ahead now obviously the metaphor is the digital computer in this by the way it fits in with the general exaggerated got that we hear nowadays about computers and robots where frequently assured by the popular press that were on the verge of having household robots that will do all i housework davies that our children amuse us with lightly conversation and take care of us in our old age and basic courses so much nonsense when nowhere near being able to produce robots that can do any unease things and indeed successful robots have been confined to very restricted tasks in very limited context such as automobile production lines well let's get back to the air his reasons that people have for supposing that cognitive isn't as true for us to halt they suppose that they actually have some psychological evidence that its troops i don't intend to savor a much about this evidence because i think everyone would agree it is quite inconclusive and subject to a lot of different interpretations however underlined that computational interpretation of the evidence is that deeper and i believe more influential reason for accepting connected its the second reason goes like this because we can design computers that follow rules when they process information and because apparently human beings also follow rules when they think ben as some unitary sense in which the brain and a computer are functioning in a similar indeed may be the same fashion the third this option that lies behind a cognitive research program is an old one that goes back as far as allied knutsen probably as far as plato is the assumption that a mental achievement must have theoretical causes is the assumption that if the output of the system is meaningful in this sense that for example our ability to learn a language or our ability to recognize faces is a meaningful cognitive ability and that must be sound theory internalize somehow on our brains that underlies this ability well what shall we make of these arguments for connected as a idled elite that i haven't knocked down a reputation of connected to some in a way that i do believe i have won four strong ai but i believe that if we examine the arguments that are given in favor of card into this and we will see that they are very weak indeed and in fact an exposure their weaknesses will enable us to understand several important differences between the way human beings behaved at the way computers function but start with emotional role following britt told a human beings follow rules that let computers followed what was that once argued that as a crucial difference in the case of human beings whenever we follow our rules we are being guided by the actual content or the meaning of the role in a case that human rules following meanings cause behavior now of course they don't cause debate are all by themselves but they certainly play a causal role in the production of the behavior so cats and other ruled drive on the left hand side of the road in great britain al ever icon of britain nine after a mine myself in this role has it worked to say that i love being the rule is to say that the meaning of that role that is its semantic content play some kind of causal role in the production of what i actually do now is that they allowed some other roles aware describe what's happening but they're not the roles that i happen to be following so free sample assuming that ahmad tulane road and that the steering wheel is located on the right hands that the car then you could say that my back a year is in accord with the rules drive in such a way that the steering wheel is nearest to the center line of the realm now that he's infected correct description of my behavior but that's not the rule by following brett the rule i thought we is drive on the left hand side of the road i wanna make his point completely clear solana gave the another example when i children went to the oakland driving school they were taught our rules for parking cars or rule lies maneuver your cart toward occurred with the steering wheel in the extreme right position until your front wheels are even with the rear wheels of the car in front of you then turn the steering wheel pull away to extreme left position now not as if they're following this rules than its meaning must play a causal role in the production of their behavior i was interested to learn this rule be his is not a rule that i follow in thank health law or rule that all my park a car i just look at the curb and try to get as close to the curb as i can without bashing into the cars in front of and behind me but not as it might turn out that my behavior viewed from outside viewed externally is identical with the behavior of a person who's following the role of formal properties of the behavior are not sufficient to show their rule is being followed in order that the role be followed the meaning of the roll past the place some calls will roll in the behavior alamo arlen this discussion for trying to do this and can be put very simply in this sense in which human beings follow rules and it suddenly human beings follow rules a whole lot less than cart made this claim they do it in that sense computers don't follow rules that all they have only act in accord with certain formal procedures for a program of the computer determines the various steps of the machinery will go through it determines how one estate will be transformed into a subsequent state at weekends speaking metaphorically as if this were a matter of following rules that in the literal sense in which human beings fowler rules computers do not follow rules they only act as if they were following rules bassett metaphors are quite harmless indeed there both common and useful in science we can speak metaphorically of any system as if it were following rolls the solar system for example damascus are only becomes harmful if its confused with a literal sense it's okay to use a psychological metaphor to explain the computer that confusion comes when you take them metaphor electrically and then try to use the computer to explain the psychology so we have to sense is a role following a literal annum metaphorical and it's very easy to confuse the two dial up applying the lessons of this example to the notion of information processing i. believed an ocean of information processing embodies a similar massive confusion the idea is that since i process information wise thing and says mike calculating machine processes information when it takes something as inputs transforms it and produces information as output then m. s. b.'s them unitary sensor which where both processing information but that seems dummy obviously fall's best sensor which i knew information processing what i think is the sense in which i am consciously or unconsciously engaged in certain mental processes but didn't accents of information processing back calculator doesn't do information processing since he doesn't have any mental processes at all its simply mimic source simulates the formal features of the mental processes but i am that he is even a of the steps of a calculator ghost through are formally this same as the steps that i go through it when you show that the machine does anything at all like what i do but a very simple reason that a calculator has no mental phenomena in adding six and three it doesn't know that the normal six stance of the numbers six and that the norell three's dance with the number three u. n. that applied science stands for the operation of a base in a mass at a very simple reason that it doesn't know anything indeed that's why we have calculators bacon to jocular asians faster and more accurately than we can without having to go through any medal effort to de wet in the sense in which we have to go through information processing they don't we need then to make a distinction between two senses of the notion of information processing or at least two radically different kinds of information press it's the first kind which i will call psychological information processing involves mental states to play that its crew dust when people perform mental operations may actually think and think uncharacteristically involves processing information of one kind or another but that's another sense of information processing in which there are no mental state at all in these cases there are processes which are as if there were some mentally information processing going on that's called east second kinds of cases of information processing and e. f. forms of information processing its perfectly harmless to use both of these two kinds of metal iskra shuns provided we do not confuse them however what we find in cognitive ism is a persistent confusion of a two now once we see this distinction clearly we can see what the most part found weaknesses in the cognitive this argument from the fact that i do information press as saying what i think it affected the computer does information prasad singh event information processing which may stimulate the formal features that might think you it simply doesn't follow that there's anything psychologically relevant about the computer program in order to show psychological relevance to what i have to be some independent argument that the n. f. computational information processing is psychologically relevant that notion that information prasad singh is being used to mask this confusion because water expression is being used to cover two quite distinct phenomenon in short the confusion that we found about a rule following has an exact parallel in the notion of information processing however is a deeper and more settled confusion involved in this notion of information processing noticed that any as a sense of information prasad singh any system whatever can be described as if it were doing information processing and dede ouimet even use it for gathering information so it isn't just a matter of using calculators and computers as every sample water running down a hill now we can describe the water as if it were doing information processing and we might even use it to get information we might use it for example we get information about the line of least resistance in the contours of a hill but it simply doesn't follow from that that there's anything in any psychological relevance about water running downhill izzo psychology in all the reaction of gravity on water but we can apply the lessons of this point to the study of a brain if habeas back to the brain has a level of real psychological information processes to repeat people actually think unthinking goes on in their brain furthermore there also are set things going on in the brain at the narrow physiological level that actually cause our thought processes but many people supposed that in addition to these two levels the level of naive psychology at the level of narrow physiology them espy's ahmed days in a level of computational information processing now why do they suppose that i believe it's because they confused us psychologically real level of information processing without pass ability of giving as if information prasad singh descriptions of the processes that are going on in the brain so if you talk about water rolling downhill everyone can see that it's psychologically or relevant but it's harder to see that exactly the same point applies to the brain when a psychologically relevant about the brain are the facts that it contains psychological pratt's s.'s and that it has enderle physiology that causes enter realizes those assesses but the fact that we can then described other processes in the brain from act as if the information press as the point of view by its health provides no evidence that these are all psychologically real or even psychologically relevant once we're talking about the inside of a brain is harder to see the confusion but it's exactly the same confusion them next assumption to examine is the idea that behind all meaningful behavior there must be some internal theory one finds this assumption in many areas and not just in cognitive psychology self free sample john skis search for a universal grammar is based on the assumption that if there are certain features common to all languages and these features are constrained by common features of the human brain that m. s. to be an entire complex set of roles of universal grammar in the brain but a much simpler hypothesis would be that the physiological structure the brain can strains passable grammar is without the intervention of any intermediate level of roles are theories not only is this guy pattison simpler but also the very existence of universal features a language constrained by inmate features of the brain suggest that underwrote physiological level description is enough to do the job you don't need to suppose that there are any rules on top of the narrow physiological structures are a couple of analogies i hope will make this clear it's this simple fact about human vision that we can't see infrared or ultraviolet now is that because we have a universal rule of visual grammar that says don't say he can for red or ultraviolet now it's obviously because our visual apparatus simply is not sensitive to these two wins of the spectrum or it take another example if we try to do with theoretical analysis of the human ability to stay in balance while walking in my look as if there were some moral s. complex mental processes going on as if taking in its use of various kinds we solve this series and quite ready to equations unconsciously of course eddie's enabled us to walk without falling over but we actually know that this sort of mental theory is not necessary to account to the achievement of walking without falling over in fact it's got to have area large part by fluid in the air here that simply doodle calculating all it is better out enough so as to upset the fluids you're likely to fall over dai ought to suggest that a great deal of our cognitive achievements may will be like that the brain just does not we have no good reason for such housing that in addition to the level of our mental states at the level of our narrow physiology there is some unconscious calculating going on concert face recognition we all recognize the faces of our friends or relatives and acquaintances quite effortlessly and indeed we now have evidence that certain portions of the brain are specialized for face recognition as a work well suppose we were going to design a computer that could recognize faces as we do it would carry out aquatic computational tasks involving a lot of calculating a geometrical and topographic o. features but is that any evidence that the way that we do it involves calculating and computing notice that when we step in when stanton makeup footprint me there are eight no essay and does any computing but if we were going to design a program that would calculate the top college e. of a footprint from information about differential pressures on the sand it would be a fairly complex computational tasks the fact that computational simulation of a natural phnom in an involves complex information prasad singh does not show that the phenomenon itself involves such processing and e. u. and maybe that facial recognition is a simple and as automatic as making footprints in the san indeed if we pursue that computer analogy consistently we find that there are a great many things going on in the computer that are not computational processes either for example in a case as some jocular yours if you ask how as the jocular multiply seven times three the answer is it at three to itself seven times but if you ask and how is it at three to itself there isn't any cabbie taste or answer to that is just donnan hardware so the answer to that question gets it just doesn't have what i suggest that for a great many absolutely fundamental abilities such as our ability to see or our ability to learn a language there may not be any theoretical mental level underlying those abilities the brain just does not we are narrow physiologically so constructed that the assault of photons in our photo receptors sells enables us to see that we are narrow physiologically so constructed that this stimulation of hearing other people talk and interacting with them will enable us to learn a language not not sang the role to play no role in our behavior on the contrary rules of language or rules of games for example seemed a play a crucial role in the relevant behavior but i am saying that it's a very tricky question to decide which parts of behavior are ruled governed and which are not and we can't just assume that bull meaningful behavior has some system of rules underlying it are one to conclude this lecture on a more positive note by saying what the implications of this approach sharpest study in the mind as a way of countering that carnage this picture let me presented alternative approach to the solution of the problems besetting the social sciences but have banned any idea that there is a computer program between the mind of the brain think of the mind and mental processes as biological phenomenon which are as biologically based is growth or digestion of the secretion of bio thinking my visual experiences for example as the end product of a series of of bands that begin with the assault of photons honor retina and end somewhere in the brain now there will be to gross levels of description in the causal account of how vision takes place in animals there will be first the level of the narrow physiology a level at which we can discuss individual neurons sim apps is an action potentials but within this narrow physiological level there will be lowered at higher levels of description it is necessary to confine ourselves solely ten oran sunset absence we can talk about the behavior of groups are modules of neurons such as the different levels of types of neurons in the wreck not whether columns in the cortex that we can talk about the performance of the neuro physiological systems at much greater levels of complexity such is the role of the strike a chord tax invasion on the role of zones eighteen and nineteen in the visual cortex or the relationship that in the visual cortex of the rest of the brain and processing visual stimuli so within that rolfe is the logical level there will be a series of levels a description all of them equally marrow physiological now in addition to that there will also be a mental level description reno for example that perception is a function of expectation that you expect to see something you'll see a much more readily minnows furthermore that perception can be affected by various metals phenomena we know that mood and emotion can affect how and what one perceives an inky and when he and his mental level within this level of intention audi there will be different levels of description we can talk not only about how perception is affected by individual beliefs and desires but also about how it is affected by such global mantle phenomenon as the person's background abilities or his general world outlook that in addition to the level of the narrow physiology and the level of intention audi we don't need this suppose there's another level a level of digital computational processes and there's not a ball and singing about the level of mental states and the level of narrow physiology as information prasad singh provided we do not make the confusion of supposing that the real psychological information processing is the same as the and the f. form other information processing and clothes and where are we in our assessment of the cognitive this research program well i have certainly not demonstrated that its false it might turn out to be true i think its chances of success are about as great as the chances of success of behavior is in fifty years ago that is to say i think its chances of success are virtually nail one ahead and argue it is however is simply the following three things first bats suggested the ones you laid bare the basic assumptions behind connected in some burial plausibility is quite apparent that these assumptions are in large part very deeply seated in our intellectual culture sat with him are very hard to root out or even to become fully conscious of my first claim is that once we fully understand the nature of the assumptions varian plausibility is manifest this second point i've made is that we don't actually have sufficient empirical evidence for supposing that these assumptions are true since the interpretation of the existing evidence rests on any ambiguity in certain crucial notions such as the notion of information processing or rule following and third eye presented an alternative view both in this lecture and the first lecture of the relationship became a brain and mind of you that does not require us to pass late in the intermediate level of helder is make computational processes mediating between the narrow physiology of the brain and the intentional idiom in mind the feature that picture which is important that this discussion is that in addition to a level of mental state that his beliefs and desires at a level of narrow physiology there is no other level no daft filler is needed between the mind of the brain because there's no gap to fill the computer is probably no better and no worse as a metaphor for the brain that earlier mechanical metaphors we learn as much about the brain by saying it's a computer as we do by saying it's the telephone switchboard at telegraph system all water pump or a steam engine by all are all objective in these lectures is to try to answer some of the most puzzling questions about how human beings speed into the rest of the universe in my first lecture i tried to solve them mind body problem in this second i disposed of some extreme claims that identify human beings with digital computers in this one i ever raised some doubts about the card into this research program i now want to turn my attention to explaining the structure of human actions than nature the social sciences and the problem of the freedom of the wheel it then listening to apart costs can meet and i said the b. b. c. at least a chance to mold and cost the state to take the piece he don't kid shot hugh k. /slash t.
