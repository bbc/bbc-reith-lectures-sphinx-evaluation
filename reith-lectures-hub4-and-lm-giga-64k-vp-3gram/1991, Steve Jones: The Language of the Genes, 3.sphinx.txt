might be useful tons up its use to try and halt the invader in different places different genes become available at the fest what tandy's used even if it is not the best when faced with emergency people also tend to expediency which turned out to be expensive but area shows the lucian does the same thing some of the protective mechanisms that mesa populations which had taken advantage of some
