this is a cold carlos from the arc colleagues of the b. b. c. recollect chairs this lecture in this series busting it seems to run by jeffrey sachs was originally brought constitute his incessant canal unwelcome to beijing for the second in the sea is serious and reflexes in title besting it seems to then in the drama of the ten thousand masses at the china center for economic research at peking university and his unit that's the case to court peking university is the fifth time the b. b. c. has according to the threat in china and we couldn't be in a war that could create a spot to more than concrete time not retire a trajectory saxby international economist said at the scene for his documents "double-quote great power has kept and must cooperate if top tennis is not to be saying to d. c.'s written poverty stricken devastation no way is more important in these patients in china ,comma to one .point three billion people now being transformed into a double ,comma the norwest interference and strength work china chooses to do and more importantly ,comma she chooses to do it will be crucial in the next phase of the world's development is a recent eighty four of china's has already come to pass a price not policing the damage that's been done to attain byrom and it's still a one party state without democratic nations and many in the west indies at the qana tenfold ,comma from the world stage into the contest is matched to the individual to the t. n. steelman writes the key message he has a reputation in the people's republic of banishing rethinking latest cannot ortiz tonight on many of the students as well as academics jennifer and businessmen who will discuss the case is linked to the test tube is welcome to seize bt seed recent track jiffy sacks packed a asked who did it ever thought it had what produce studied here kicking university and to be together for which you would end what a thrill it is for me to have the chance of this unique lecture series to reap lectures to have a part in a global discussion of discussion that we must have eaten the beginning years of our new century if we are to which she is what we hope to which he met its peace and prosperity shared around the planet aidid we all sense that we are a very important decision points in the planet's and with obvious risks than with huge opportunities and isu just sat there is no place on the planet of more significance for these choices before it so that only segment as well as for the world's eight q. that as china today u. one treated in every single way your calls for superlatives units or roll its dimensions saluted and of the stakes for the world here we are getting famous sit and beautiful magnificent hall of the big ten fouls and hit the masses as is called but if you think about it to a four china's fastest we would need to a hundred thirty thousand such halls of textiles and people each to accommodate the one .point three billion people of this country to country so fast that of course ,comma it is one fifth of the world's population and quickly becoming a u. absolut is center of global economy as well as many of the challenges that will discuss tonight not only use it the world's most populous country is one of the world's most crowded contras and it is certainly one of them mostly bar mentally stay arrests of regions of the world i call my lectures that today's yet for the seat eight term deduce a una spectacular of lee's visit is permitted invented by one of the great scientists of our age paul kreutz and to signify the fact that human being is for the first time have taken hold not only of an economy for our population and a very physical systems of the planet itself and from the scene of meeting human created etiquette aren't also is earth's history be geologists call our time the whole scene that's the period of the last thirteen thousand years or so since the last ice age recruits in why sweet and perhaps others shockingly noted that the last two hundred years are really made you need that they not only in human history but in the physical purchase history as well yet from the scene is the period when human activities has overtaken vast parts of the natural cycles on planet and it has done so when in ways that the range of those cycles and that fundamentally threaten asked indeed in the years ahead now considering how we're going to face the dual challenge of seed continued economic progress which we dearly hope for in this concrete and a other parts of the developing world and continued economic well being of course and progress in today's already high heat ,comma world how we can combine that economical wheat before falling again growing in farm apple dangers to which face a is the subject of our reflections today's what's absolutely striking and paul's always need to solve is the basic facts as follows while we are already doing on the planet in terms of the facts and physical systems is literally on sustainable week could not go on doing what we're doing so we have already reached the point that both literal and sustainability is sensitive weekend team you're on our current path using resources the way we use them now that the scale we use them now we would be hit very harsh boundaries that would do great damage to human wellbeing said this is a whole herd any to vast numbers literally millions of other species on the planet bought we haven't even harder problem to solve the now one and that is we don't want to stop your in terms of where we are urging consumption or economic activity to develop a hard freeze and worrying the most populous and call them but to develop a world which is five or six of humanity right to leave and understandably says they would like their place at the site is well if the i. a. ,comma world as a chief aide ,comma levels of comfort levels of attila the safety and life expectancy of a vast proportions will one about the rest of humanity and from my point of view is a development economist something absolutely water full is happening something that i think we could get it all at the age of convergence and that is the measure of economic development the methods the institutions to processes the agitation of advanced technologies is becoming a worldwide phenomenon now tragically not every part of the world as yet part of that phenomenon and i will have the chance to discuss that in a later lecture when we talk about the poorest of the four were still not part of this dynamism but wonderful loses that large parts of the planet are part of its dynamism china is of course do the very forefront most dramatically amid unprecedented matter catching up in technology economic activity human wellbeing and let's not golf the improvements of living not only don't know a conventionally measured living standards but acumen wellbeing and white expectancy victory should get opportunities you chances to fulfill lights hopes that ,comma along with his economic improvement and the process is now are powerful through the powerful wheeze of globalization to market forces futility of ideas and technology to flow across national boundaries and a precedent to great so we have the world economy now growing at approximately five percent proud of and that is up four percent to approximately of per capita aidid ,comma he increases the and one percent per year were off week of the global population increased but that he is we are on course for a massive decreased of economic activity just what's we would like to see getty still poorer countries of the world those who aspire to happy chances of that technology in science have brought us and it is fair to say that given current trends we have a powerful forces of economic convergence in most parts of the world and gives the processes of convergence continue to operate as they had to be in recent decades one could expect that perhaps the average per person a calm on the planet could rise as much as four times between now and the century population of course no increasing more slowly in proportional terms than it did in the second half of the twentieth century is still increasing in absolute terms by an astounding amount of seventy two with eighty million people per year and in the medium forecasts only you when population division that leads to a projection of a rough week eight garuda increase of another two when a half billion people on the planet by the year twenty fifty ross elite population increasing by eight close to fifty percent eat ,comma and a half bari disasters of various kinds to decrease proximate lee fourfold multiplying wanted a half times for suggests that the current economic trajectory would lead to a decrease of world economic activity of six times between now and twenty fifty now that's the bull from the point to view of economic development but think about the paradox it already we are in eight lead early and sustainable trajectory and yet china india large parts of asia are successfully barreling ahead now we have unprecedented leave rapid economic development were asking some how our planet to absorb eighty many fold the increase of economic activity in top posts in already existing degree did fire mental stress that we never before seen on the planet of course we'd actually courted not do this we would not be able to decrease sixfold in economic activity ,comma are current technologies for the environmental catastrophes would literally choke off this economic growth back arch immersed in water stressed before station owner or the various parts of the world species extinction would cause this projection could override even before we were able to do such grave damage on the planet but that does pose the fundamental question what will give the union now many people think the only state that he views it is the living standards and high income world and some council that they will ask to be crushed where his father is a bullied fit we are balm for the bitter struggle between the rich and the four in the years ahead i want to argue with that their use the only way for peacefully body heat is saved by a whole way for an daddy's eight changes of the wheat we live that allows for continued improvement of living standards in all parts of the world that allows for the aspirations of catching up but doesn't also permit us to score in the circle of environmental stress and economic development now what can we do does it mean that any economic growth does it needs to ended the hopes of the developing world doesn't need die or cutbacks of living conditions and abbott ebullient today's rich world idle lead that there is another course and it's of course we must take there are at least three ways out of this ,comma and for first of course he's why use fuel efficiency of energy efficiency so that we can get more economic output wheat last direct use of fossil fuels sat in the oak or says the substitution of not fossil fuels for the fossil fuel so that per unit of energy the additions of carbon dioxide can be reduced whether it's nuclear power safely deployed for war economical solar power for windows or biomass there's definitely a role filled perhaps not as dramatic as we might hope for a substitution of the non fossil tools for today's heavy dependence more than eighty percent of our commercial energy use this as a third alternative as well and that is to learn to use our existing fossil fuels safely and for china and india this is perhaps the single most important holes for these countries and for the planet one idea on the drawing board which needs to get the two demonstration of production in this country as soon as possible and that means nearly immediately is the idea of power plants which burn coal to generate electricity capturing the carbon dockside that they would otherwise have made palm bigoted white clients and pumping it eighty to the euro into state geologic reservoirs now that the question for the planet and unprecedented challenge to move to weigh sustainable energy system requiring eight degree of cooperation and foresight and planning any time dimension of decades kennelly do when it we find that that level of public understanding political consensus direction and determination we may take it with a nice beaches but the climate will change whether we take it or not there is no state aid is one this one gets depended not on what we actually do not what we say we do now very quickly i want to mention one whole pull analogy and bad news column we have successfully as a world avoided what seemed to be another and was another desperate risk and now was the depletion of the ozone layer it was discovered by paul fruits and you'd scientist who brought us the chance for the c. e. challenge of ozone as well he and two colleagues sure when brolin did mario molina discovered accidentally as it were dated each capitals the we use for refrigeration and for our aerosols that floor floor carpets the c. f. c. east posed a grave risk to survive on the planet because of their accidental interactions in the stratosphere that quitting had destroyed the ozone layer yu was an accidental discovery of brilliant science it took some euro for the public to be aware that when the scientists said that the neighbors of the c. s. c. said it best in science we fertile for their way adding to that i asked but then nasa in the united states to snap the picture from one of its remarkable satellites show when a hole in the ozone layer it away in a heated picture that saved the world is as soon as people saw that hole with their own ties they weren't listening to the chairman of dupont anymore they were feeding about their survival in the survival of their children to public awareness sorted that pressure for action decreased at appoint dupont and other companies scientists went to work on a determined there was an alternative to the c. f. c.'s door all are safer ,comma holes that could be heard for jurists that could be a deodorant cast baited beady aerosols not surprising after all they found them and a fourth stapp took place a whispered in the years of the politicians he so paid you could reach an international agreement we can handle this and quickly actually remarkably quickly from the basic science to the international agreements took about fifteen years and by nineteen ninety eight global framework was in place that called for the phasing out of the chlorofluorocarbons and has put us on a path of eddies of relative safety with regards to that risk with climactic i believe we have the same hopes now a much more difficult issue eight problem dating gets to the core of the functioning of the world economy so one that cannot be solved from one aide to the next requiring eight basic change of heart infrastructure are energy systems which will take decades to complete but process nonetheless that aidid is underway in the same way the first a new science back in eighteen ninety six event in modern science in the last twenty five years and as soon as the science kane came big companies would investigate crusade jocks science because that's very state star bobby but you don't lobby against nature nature has its principles it doesn't matter what the boards of these companies say what matters is the actual physical mechanisms to science was right it becomes more and more known now why he bozo crisis public awareness has been a second stapp for along time climate change was discussed as something for the far future now woods understood assaulting imperiling asked today as well the heat wave in europe in two thousand three claiming more than twenty thousand lives for aid to treat out aids storm devastated proportion shopping the american people and the world about what climate can do more deeply negative routes in australia that took place this year and destroyed a substantial part of australia's export crop that nasa typhoons being experienced by this country as well as the warming taking place in large parts of this country and severe droughts in the curator of china have all made the climate change at immediate issue it understandable issue and one bit of courses will get worse than going to see is this scientists and engineers are now scurrying technological alternatives are being developed target capturing seek west ration is beginning to be put to a good place to demonstration projects so to alternative not fossil fuel energy zora says and sold to remarkable breakthroughs in energy efficiency such as hydrated and plugging hybrid automobiles which promise last of vastly more efficient automobiles so more of my wood should per kilometer or model driven it good news is that those technological breakthroughs are similarly leading big companies to whisper in the years of the politicians it so kate we can handle this and asked the best news of all the companies around the world are now when the lead of their politicians in fact they're telling the politicians we half act we want a framework we needed incentive mechanism we need a price structure so that we can move ahead we sustainable energy i always forget to get their we'd all be global negotiations on a truly global framework in december of this year in bali indonesia weaker greeted principle on a framework convention on climate change that we must stabilize greenhouse gases we took it up early small step in the so called kyoto protocol but his only involve the very small set of commitments for a limited part of the world may lead europe because the united states did not beat detroit now when december wheat masa happy you west and china eightieth any european union and other parts of the world all coming together and say we must do this for ourselves and for the future nature had spoken more loudly investigate truce this is not a matter of vested interests this is a matter of common interest the staff's from the science to the public awareness to the technological alternatives to the international agreements are the very steps that we will need even for all aspects of piano for a seat this will be a marker of our new hero science based global policy making peacetime worldwide public awareness basket to be true for stating the rain forests for seating and borrowed shoes from overfishing for managing water stress and for choosing population alternatives that are sound for the planet and sound for the individuals as well we don't happen to which sapped the population trends because people would choose fertility reduction voluntarily in large parts of the developing world that the alternatives are made available to them in their individual choices as well weekend to this and we will learn that the costs of action are tiny in fact compared to the risks of the inaction climate change can be solved according to the best current estimates for less than one percent of world economic each year and perhaps well under that where the potential costs are a devastating multiple of several percent of world income if we continue on to business as usual trajectory i won at any of where i started the first lecture when my favorite speech of president john kennedy he talked about the challenge of peace that he is our biggest challenge on the planet and peace is also threatened by environmental risk but he also told lespinasse beach that we have chances he said it and i repeat because i think the use our common thread our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by a man and man can be a speed as he walks no problem human destiny is beyond human beings man's resented spirited off insolvency italy unsolvable and we believe they can do would again that is the spirit of the net for the c. i. q. for much pack fifty sacks thank you very much indeed time nineteen taking questions from a people hitting the ground of the ten thousand masses of the key new investing and i'd like to invite it to protect christian festival yu yang jie uses french yeas cannot link students ghent peking university will have few christians who think he is back in his tales about to what extent should made protecting garments as lindh is a complex intake in rum until protection and economic development is alive and are staying close but it has always stopped economic development for a steak house in armand opened talks in sanaa classed as astutely find about alter aren't speaking to thank you the choice that sometimes puts economics versus the environment views largely misstated the date the part it is part of the economic well being it's knocking contrast economic well being not let the state that choices that we actually face on how to use land how the fish are how to use our energy resources are less dire and less painful than we think if we will closely at our real opportunities especially with technology i talked about the new kinds of sustainable energy systems that we can adopt at relatively low cost but let me talk about it other massive overfishing of the oceans we'd eat wood destruction of the fisheries china is the pioneer now had a global scale but alternative i hope coulter so massive fish farming and china viewed farms that perhaps eighty to ninety percent of all the world's fish farming now that's a technology farming to fish rather than depleting the oceans begins is hopeful that it's not as my cresson is that pollack and you will make china needs to understand is nice to millions and millions of people just see their hope to be calm reach or have that opportunity to change their mature alive the appointees that the cost of this are not to say to the chinese people you will not achieve economic development board to the american people for that matter purity ,comma levels will be deeply undermined know that's the point the point is if we mobilize our science and technology well if we prove that demonstrated the fumes carbon captured seats was rationed or other technologies will find that we can why sleep to zip course out of its if we simply are too afraid to neglect full radically greedy already simple mindedly shortsighted benny the dangers will mount weld welby yon the cost of we would pay with clear action that's what needs to be explained many bringing james king syndication rights turns into wet in the far east for the cost to the high teens to batista book about the rise of china and counting heads in the business operations in a case in the international media company james locust jeffrey muir of speech youth that painted a picture of regina rethink picture of a global environmentalists don't and you said that one of the keys in a resting its case public advocacy in other words giving people the voids so those people can keep governments in the big companies ,comma it's bad as you well know time there is no up speed in giving people the voids is atop the a government at the central level as of the very keen understanding of the environmental issues but often at local levels governments are corrupt and that in bed with the big cruising companies so what would you say it isn't remotely possible that china will have drew out enough pluralism enough public advocacy and enough democracy to solve the environmental problems that you are outlined it is not only remote leaf that possible i think it's very likely in fact he's gunfire mental challenges salute our not feeding from fuel there felt to be in the daily lives of people living in the john c. beat massive pollution that has been seen the heady here pollution and the cities of china and doll or a whole world that is going to be a saint to china very soon perhaps so within the next three or four years you'll cut people's republican are the number one and a turk of carbon dioxide in the whole world so whenever you think you're affecting the whole world's climate what could be interesting is that this title over takes the united states is the largest maker you less says that a star complaining bitterly what are you going to our clients a week ahead is to set himself a fan as so what's going to happen is that the whole world is more and more will understand that this use daughter we are seeing the change would be just the last three or four years of public awareness not because the theory not because of lectures but because of what is being felt in daily lives i've had excellent discussions with the chinese leadership over the last year ,comma these issues they are fully aware of this and i believe that this is going to be the realization he this concrete in a yet even in the united states of war or of finding a few new west politics the change in the last you are fit his remarkable katrina and the other force of nature vice president al gore has had his head have also asked that process about his team's one to get oscars for climate change you got to know the war on our way this thing or two is using is assigned an volunteering and beating the new anstey would selling its competitions i agree that the central government than at the big and laments that they realize the big problems but do what what i've seen in many other generous to go around the country is seen time and time again is that local governments do not obey his interim government and they are corrupt and then all sinking about the planet with inky about their own short term profits at item seat really any progress in africa any intent of the only subject to fry could stymie admitting that some people who can't stand it and who would not speak on the city gets him in a tie to sunny garden james that what he does ,comma similar in scope and a friend that these reports are from the c. t. v. one day they went to look completely gel because you know that my knees in the columns the moms who shocked outposts small e. beagle minds get back to see his to the stress they essential commonsense to corral it but a second mother involvement because the whole conti is done ,comma is the pending in the minds if they cost there is no economy further okonski bath of prominent singers when looking at me just bringing up the nile that questioning him on the foundered because it's on the subject of his time making smock to hussein and said it had essentially nine stations in china called the institute of public environment defense has a new question high i'm glad not to mention in today's ward of globalized asia and we need more cooperation on the global m. barnett of governance we are running a national water pollution database on recent play when we clapton is stoked water polluters and we came across a field in a sixty seven to multinational companies from japan from us from euro and they will call by the local agencies of violating the basic discharge standards and this freeze concern over a global transfer of pollution in today's what caught globalize that commanded factoring but some in the western countries argued that city bilko companies are polluting nan d'amato nationalist as should not be blamed for doing the same in this country and i want to hear your comments on at the fair at all of these is points are correct and also need to be understood in a dynamic process uses using no doubt the flight for new ways of doing things in this country and in the world many of the examples is that it had been given could have been examples that you need any of our countries market forces by themselves are often quite powerful long quite shortsighted because markets don't heed clued he sold troll the damages that go along with the suit polluting or resource depleting activities adequately and therefore we need to be collective action did countervailing sta market i am not arguing that from one gate to the next we're going to have a change that is going to solve these problems he the guy said many times just on climate change issue this will actually take decades to bases across about double standards disease across about rots and nationalist denny mendez hulett killed easiest brazen in japan is bringing that toxic waste to let it sell confucius elected not to have to do well to the west is doing that he had won two other cities that often seems to have cooperation from houston to ring up with the west would she want to hire this guy i don't call it double standards it's just we have poor environmental performance all over the world there's not a place in the world that is truly a fire that police to stay a total output is still hope that his toll still because the whole world climate is being changed what we are also in a process of tremendous global recognition and rise of understanding of this just in a short period of time aidid will predicts that by twenty ten we have eight poles kyodo agreement reached one that has included all conferees china the united states' european union and others that the greek to targets that are serious about heading off this kind of environment of the past eight years time china had us we're will agree to the doubts what i said i'll say it again eiffel lead that fight juanita and we will have a post kyodo global paprika one beats you to get the dilapidated and steve have what it had been in hiding in the got -hyphen i don't know what i'm predicting it and i do that and i are getting it on the basis of the party that haitians benign aid which is that these issues dole from the site and to the public awareness to the technological options to the agreements and i think we're getting that phase right now actually what's different about ron numb not await him by saying things are changing and actually putting a date on it as well i believe that by twenty ten we will have an agreement i believe good to be more specific that every major presidential candidate in the united states for its apple in the two thousand made election will have a strong climate change plant also will see that in real time whether a crime of right or merely dreman wrecking the reason i believe that this is happening is that the scientific consensus is sound because the major oil companies are actually running advertisements every day you the global press about the dangers of climate change now solving has changed ,comma for the better and that's a good point in the if not in a dainty and jonathan bullet sees the guardian correspondent hitting southeast asia ,comma with its pink here ,comma i came back today from new fund which is the pasquale views being declared as the most polluted city of hope from a conde it was particularly horrible but the message was contradictory villas on one side the local government said that they wouldn't clarice down a hundred and sixty of a hundred leaching allying pliant founders which says it has huge said it is more environment awareness here or the other side of most local people said we don't believe the government we don't trust the media that people is that you said we could get in trouble if we speak to another said we don't want this to bar mitzvah when current changes we have no way of affecting government policy some requesting his fist pieces still have one policy dictates a ship what'd you think is the role rudolph public accountability in improving the environment than if i could just be a devils after could in some place within it the best of it free -hyphen agreeing to take to ship to solve the world's problems rather than agreeing democracy will i pay the public accountability is extremely important but the problem is in sight of these foundries he's not the problem of one political system it's a problem of low pulled the puck ,comma the baby's truly united states for trying out for that many other places where you have the local economy depending on the probably defunct technology at this point that his field top the set of jobless in an environmentally unsustainable manner and that is a pop challenge anywhere so one needs a set of instruments and institutions to provide either alternatives to welcome retrofit factories to providing compensation for the fire metal wood jost meant and so forth in a lot of those institutions don't exist a in this country because the challenges are awaiting faced right now for the first time that the p. c. could see was how important these democracy will someday and into democracy in china are obsolete and think them op i agree that most of what he said but i think you do kind of dollars to that question that has so many foreign leaders who form businessmen coming to china not to his will once told about human rights and democracy to have a lot of things go that way there are no facilities for doing what in environmental issues and then she owes the night they would quit demote ciba think they would like malts pools today would influence government policy and in the schools in the last world than the free media in votes from base things we still don't have the time that suggests how important his mesa democracy to china's development in your view i think that china will become more democratic overtime and i think that china will become as i say any centralized overtime this well this is the beach for above the developments taking place and are already apparent that this fund for if one has any sense of change that's taking place this is already happening and it's happening to the good and i really don't believe for that outsiders ,comma a u. n. meeting civil claims so it really helps the process i do believe that china's politics are for the chinese people and i believe that these changes will come they will be china's interests they will be the world's interest but the way to the world should best handled this is to help china would cheated schools tend to find global ,comma points of the meeting and global challenges like climate like a global security because these are the ways that we can build trust build understanding and build a framework worked change can take place in a peaceful and useful way
