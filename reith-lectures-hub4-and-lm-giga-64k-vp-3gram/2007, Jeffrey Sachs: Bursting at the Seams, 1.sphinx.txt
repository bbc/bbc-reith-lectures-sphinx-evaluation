and those to hong we had so momentous choices to make economical to describe it in tonight's ended in the future lectures a won a star with my favorite speech should the modern american presidency and i think one of the mostly poor and statements made in modern times and sacked one truly did change the course of history never foray to john kennedy's commencement address at american university to

base and went to president john kennedy said in that the acting resonates today he'd end is in poor and for all us in all parts of the world to permit needed quote from it so well that it went just at the beginning i do believe that hopes to set the stage set first examined are added to towards peace itself to many of us think it is impossible to many think it is a real but that is a dangerous defeatist belief it leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable that mankind is doomed to we're grit by forces we cannot control need not accept that you are problems are manmade deer or they can be solved by a man and married in the year's big as he wants no problem of human destiny is deion human beings man's reason and spirit have often saw the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do woody danny i'd not referring to the absolute need stinnett concept of universal peace including will woods some fantasy scene fanatics three i do not deny devalue hopes agrees but we nearly any fighters discouragement and incredulity and eighteen batters are bullied immediate goal was to focus instead on a more practical to retain a full peace based not on a social revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in each human institutions in a series of concrete actions and affected the agreements which are in the interest of all concerned there is no single simple key to this peace no grander magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers genuine peace must be the product of many nations to solve many acts it must be dynamic not static changing to meet the challenge of each new generation for peace is a process eighty wheat on solving problems i wanna talk about the challenge of our generation ours is not the generation in the face the challenge of fascism artist is not a generation had first grab hold with the nuclear d. n. don't we still grapple with the today ours is not the generation in the face of cold war ours is not a generation incidentally the greatest problem is the war and terror or rotting or other ideas so current our challenge our generation's unique challenge is learning to leave in an extraordinarily crowded world our planet is unprecedented leafed crowded it called a bursting at the seams and its first hit the seams in human terms economic terms and ecological terms this is the greatest challenge of learning to leave in the interconnected world of local unprecedented pressures of cuban society and to any attack on the physical environment we don't need to treat eye yet going to talk about concrete actions i going to discuss idaho effective agreements and most importantly i wanna talk about wheat on solving problems it's a fascinating and crucial concept for its peace as a wheat in solving problems we clearly are not out after problem solving now when the world we are not actively decreasing risk any decreasing the stability and i are all but objective measures capacity precinct eighty in the world as well we have not found any wheat looks solving problems that our generation faces now most importantly for aust in this crowded planet facing the challenges of living face to face is never before been facing a day ,comma and ecological challenge that simply was never promised in human history told not to we're solving problems for players at one fundamental change of the one and now is learning that the challenges of our generation are not asked versus n. b. a. are not asked versus islamic asked versus the terrorists also persists or ron bearer also all lost together on this planet against a set of shared a decreasing leber urgent problems and bite understanding those problems understanding them at their depth understanding what we do share would every part of this world is unique to face these challenges we can find peace and that talk about three common problems that we face their nature connected they build on each other gateways to amplify your free aid to approached changer broke risk tightly not only your responses to the threats we face and are challenges which put us all the common fate the first challenge that all talk about is the challenge of what all fruits and has magnificently cold the ants are fussy the idea that for the first time in history the physical systems of the planet accountable flexes the climate itself habitat that biodiversity evolutionary ross's

challenge of geopolitics at talents that i'm going to call the deed of convergence in any way he sits in wonderful news hits the beach but i didn't serve in my activities since starting economic development needs to know she dated eight king acted world media are connected than ever before in a euro were economic development at least for the last two hundred fifty years and an absence whenever their hats to economic development is driven by technology and not in a world where those technologies to fuse and can defuse rapidly around the world and did a fabulous prospects and that's a prospect for the grafted closing of the economic gaps that nowotny sits between the rich and poor dear will leave in our time a fundamental shift of economic power and the political power that goes along with its we started this decade with the fantasy that fantasy growth the united states is the world's sole superpower the fantasy of united states is the sole e. dispensable power do was call the fantasy would wish to know from history always to be wrong and dangerous the united states is the euro beresford died to take out the pura natalie wood by song who bought no la batter about this but it was a fantasy because just as this was being proclaimed was the tiny when china when eightieth what other regional powers are comments to be increasing their power and their economic wheat in the world by virtue of this shared capacities to benefit from technology which is the fundamental of economic development course is an economist i do subscribe to a philosophy that was first stood initiated by adam smith in seventeen seventy six which is why so happy that he's weak lectures will take a steady growth no accidents when he talked about how local markets international trade to need a fundamental to fusion mechanism for these technologies and how it happens the third of our common challenges i wanna calls the challenges of the weakest links that is in any interconnected world all parts of the world are affected by what happens if you all the parts of the world and sometimes surprisingly so bowie can not be surprised when it thanks to some far off in distant places i'm not talking about central europe and talking about half way around the world in the land mass of eurasia cady of fundamental significance even for survival for the spending of hundreds of killings of dollars if not trillions ford the direction of global politics in any interconnected world we have great need a basic responsibility for our own survive i hope to tending to the weakest links and by that i need those places in the world itself or those places in the world were people die because they are too poor to stay alive those parts of the world where by virtue of physical geography at the genealogy klima stressed rainy saturday called for drought prone savannah climates for example peaceful witted challenges in the day getting onto the ladder of development allowed heard we choose available for all its one to get on with but were least one billion people on the planet art troupe for two hungry to disease burden to be a raft of the most basic infrastructure even to get on the ladder of development and we believe i'm sorry to say despite all the fine speeches than there had been many in the lead through our actions that this doesn't really matter if because our actions don't beat dean to address this problem we are leaving for example a deal you need people to die yet least every year because they are too poor to stay alive are challenge is to understand these comments challenges can be true incidentally that because we don't want to talk to are rotting h. five n. one will pass through or rock we will have to deal with media flew eight places we don't want a speech to because we put our preconditions to negotiations but can't see the commonality of our problems they can to relieve the ladies and gentleman that the solution to dart for one of the most hurting crises on the planet is all about peacekeepers and troops and sanctions when we'd no bidder western therefore you're delegates started because this is just about all the poorest place in the whole planet where the rebellion started because there's not enough water to keep people alive were the livestock had no veterinary care where there is no basic infrastructure were power grid eighty thousand miles away can you really think that peacekeeping troops the sanctions will solve this problem i do think we had a fundamental rethinking to do each of these areas as all this friday to be

stress would troll worsened perhaps a measure would as the glaciers of the himalayan smelter is the seasonal timing of snow melt from the latest changes the river flow of the yangtze and yellow rivers and other rivers of asia yet from the scene tells this bet it's not just one problem is sir nicholas stern city here one of her car great heroes of our time is brilliantly exposed in his report for this government is not the problem in the mass six stations it's not the problem is we've learned in recent weeks of the mass destruction of fisheries in the north atlantic and in many other parts of the world we are weighed so heavily on your assistance not only through carbondale oxide emissions changing climate but through carpet outside admissions a signifying notions we are over hunting overfishing and over gathering just about anything that grow slowly pour move slowly utica tactic we tell our capacity he entered the scene saw unprecedented poorly understood not in control and upgrade to the common threat delusions about geopolitics which had a change prevent us from solving these problems as well united states' my own country has been in a fantasy of pool going it alone if fantasy if there ever was one when our problems are so fundamentally global and share hollywood dressed climate change even if you recognize that by yourself based sol afro temporarily by not recognizing when they do recognize that they're going to have to recognize that in a shared a global way and how can it be leasing gentleman but we think we can be safe we think we can be safe would lead a billion people to struggle a little early for their daily survival and how can we choose as we do when the united states to cattle or to request this year bought six hundred fifty billion dollars for the military more than all the rest of the world combined aid for half a billion dollars for all of africa need assistance and state that this is true that one might say ode to science fiction editor so not a disease could arise and somehow spread to the world except that aids is exactly that ,comma the samples do we need to understand the linkages and a common threats and are in recklessness of levy's people to die recklessness in spirit each human heart any geopolitical safety for us not president kennedy talked about a way of solving problems and that too will be the theme of these lectures we are entering i believe a new politics and potentially a hopeful politics are going to call it the only source leadership we are going to need a new way to win drastic and to solve global problems that are connected to the will bring asked walls unimaginable even just a few years before i got to try to explain how this can be daunting ,comma without legal government we can still get global cooperation politicians like the millennium development goals can be no organizing principle for the world though there is no single implementing of the word ,comma it is possible to coalesce around share goals how scientists can play a fundamental role in this set is indeed the intergovernmental panel on climate change how the world is hungry for serious knowledge for the information from what are sometimes called esty make communities that is communities of expertise in a talk about how our governments can be reorganized the need to be reorganized because we are leading perhaps with nineteen century beady twenty century government structures for twenty first century problems are government simply do not understand the nature of these problems we need is a president kennedy set concrete actions and i'm going to discuss those as well because there's no sense in period there isn't something to do starting today and there are about all the serious things to do started a bit teammate at different speeds lightfoot that difference and we need any uses the possibility of are peter connected socially network internet empowered each we need a column in the hall last week all play a role he doesn't just go through government i'm not optimistic you might not stick tactics you might not take irritate the first time because i want to fight what she does set up all that i use you'd only a you're always stays that i'd say a circle led if there is one introductory noted is that we must not for one moment decor and an acceptable course right now because we're not but i do want to stress that fundamentally we have choices and we actually have some terrific choices we had the ability to do things at much lower cost and much greater effort to see danny o'neil stadium last kato in apart is that for example of entire malaria bad hats at not just give you one facts there are three hundred sleeping sites in africa bade each protection from malaria and tight o'leary did bad debts last by years and cost a mere five dollars one dollar a year off in more than one child sleeps under an act well once they get economists are reasonably good at his multiplication sold three hundred million sleeping sites buy dollars and that i calculate one .point five billion dollars i. also enact excitedly could've long division six hundred sixty billion dollars of military budget three hundred sixty five days that tells me that it we are spending now depending on exactly what the president gets out of this last one .point seven oh or one .point eight billion dollars per eight and the pentagon john kennedy said he needs this world changing speech for your both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combat the euro is poverty and disease and my little calculation is shown you did one dates pentagon spending could cover every sleeping site about africa for five years with the entire malaria bed nets and yet we have not found their way to that most in meeting the bargain of our time we do have choices they are good ones if we take them a one to close with one president kennedy said he disregarded i regard these as among the most beautiful lines ever wondered why a world leader said this in what could be more important for the challenges of our generation so let us not decline toward differences let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved and you cannot get our differences at least we can help make the world safe for diversity for in the final analysis are most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet we all read the same era we all cherish our children's future and we are all more think are much pack access to

hundred years ago to this year or who was still a whirl of sleepers asleep or within the british empire in eighteen oh seven the sleet trade ended we had to rule alone colonial powers know i'm not
