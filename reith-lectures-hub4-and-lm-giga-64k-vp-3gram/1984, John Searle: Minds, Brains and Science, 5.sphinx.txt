this is about cost and the talk i sit at b. b. c. to take tests this lecture in the series and my aim is the brains and signed skip them by joan sell was to resume april coast in nineteen eighty full inez lecture i want to discuss one of the most vexing intellectual problems of the present year line of the methods of the natural sciences not given us the kind of payoff in the study of human behavior that they have in subjects like physics and chemistry and what sort of social or behavioral sciences can we reasonably expect anyhow i'm going to suggest that there are certain radical differences between human baby or in the phenomena studied in the natural sciences had argued that these differences account both the failures and successes but the methods of the natural sciences of hadn't human sciences at the beginning i want to call your attention one important difference between a form of a common sense exclamations of human behavior and the standard form of scientific explanations according to the standard theory of scientific exploration explaining the phenomenon consists in showing how its occurrence follows from certain scientific awards these laws are universal generalize nations about how things happened for example if you're given a state of the relevant laws describing the behavior of a falling body than you know where it started from you can actually deduced what will happen to it similarly if you want to explain aloft you can deduce galore from some higher level long on this account explanation of production are perfectly symmetrical you predict might get to see what will happen you explained by did oozing what has happened now whatever merritt this type of explanation may have in the natural sciences one of the things i want to emphasize in his lecture is that didi is quite worthless to us in explaining human behavior and this is not because we lack laws for explaining individually campbell most of human behavior but are rather it's because the minute we headsets lawless they would still be useless to us and i think i could easily get to see that by asking you to imagine what it would be like if we actually had a loft bed is a universal generalize asian concerning some aspect of behavior suppose that in the last election you voted for the tories and suppose that you voted for the tories because you thought they would do more to solve the problem of inflation than in any of the other parties now let's suppose that just a plain fact about why you voted for the tories as it is that equally plain fact that you didn't vote for the tories suppose furthermore that some political sociologists come up with an absolutely exceptional was universal generalize asian about people who are exactly fits your description your socio economic status your income level your education your other interests in seoul on suppose this absolutely exception was generalize asian is to the affected people like you invariably boat the tories now i want to ask which explains why you voted for the tories is that the reason you sincerely accept or is it the universal generalize haitian i believe we would never accept the generalize asian as the explanation of our own behavior to generalize asian states are regularity in knowledge of such a regularity may be useful for production but it doesn't explain anything about individual cases of human behavior if they generalize issue more found it gets self would require explanation of the sort we were after the first ports and were human behavior is concerned that sort of explanation we normally seek is one that specifies the mental states double leaves spheres hopes desires and so on that functioned casale and the production of the behavior willetts returned or are original question why do we not seem to have a loss of social sciences in the sense that we have laws that natural son since not there are several standard answers to that question some philosophers point out that we don't have a science about a cure for this same reason that we don't have a science of furniture we couldn't have such a science because there are any physical features that all furniture chairs tables rugs and other such items have in common that will enable him to fall under a common set of laws of furniture and decides they argue we all really needs such as science because anything we want to explain for example why our wooden table solid or white as iron lawn furniture rest can already be explained by existing sciences similarly there aren't any features that all human behaviors have in common and the site's particular things we wish to explain can be explained by physics of physiology and all the rest of the existing science in a related argument some philosophers point out that perhaps our concepts for describing ourselves and other human beings don't match the concepts of such basic sciences as physics and chemistry in the right away that they suggest human sciences like a science of the weather we have a science of the weather meteorology but it's not a strict science because the things that interest is about the weather don't match their natural categories we have for physics so whether concepts such as bright spots over the midlands or partly cloudy in london are not systematically related to the concept of physics up powerful expression of this sort of view is in jerry photo oars work he suggests that special sciences like geology or meteorology are about features of the world that can be realized in physics in a variety of ways and that this will loose connection be to the special sciences and the more basic science of physics is also characteristic of the social sciences just this amount is in store this can be realized in different sorts of micro physical structures so money for example can be physically realized as gold or silver or printed paper and such a disk jockey of connections between the higher order phenomena and the lower order do indeed allow less behalf ridge sciences but they do not allow for strict laws because the form of the loose connections will permit laws that have exceptions another argument for the view that we cannot have strict laws connecting the mental and physical is in donald davidson's claim that the concepts of rationality consistency incoherence are partly constituting of an ocean of mental phenomena and these notions simply don't relate systematically through the motions of physics as davidson says they have no echo in physics that difficulty with as few is that there are lots of sciences which contain constituted notions that sell only have no echo in physics but are not no less pretty solid sciences biology for example requires the concept of organisms and organism has no echo in physics but biology does not thereby ceased to be a hard science another view widely held view that the complex inner relations of our mental states prevent us from ever getting a systematic set of laws connecting them to narrow physiological states but once again this argument is inconclusive suppose for example the known chime skis are right in taking that each of us has a complex set of rules of universal grammar programmed into our brains at birth but does not think about the complexity or the interdependence of the rules of universal grammar that prevents them from being systematically realized in the narrow physiology of the brain interdependence and complexity by themselves and not a sufficient argument against the possibility of strict psycho physical laws well i find all of these accounts suggested but i do not believe that they adequately capture the really rad i called differences between them mental and physical sciences the relation between sociology and economics on one hand and hence physics on the other is really quite unlike the relation for example if meteorology geology and biology and other special census to physics and we need to try to state exactly how not ideally i'd like to be able to get us step by step argument to show the limitations on the possibilities of strict social sciences and yet at the same time show the real nature of power of these disciplines i think we need to ban them once and for all the idea that the social sciences are like physics before new and that what we're waiting for is a set of new tonia law as of the human mind well first one might ask what exactly is the problems of post debate one might say surely social and psychological phenomenon are as real as anything else so why can't there be laws of their behavior why should there be a loss of the behavior of molecules to but not laws of the behavior of society's one way to disprove a thesis is to imagine that it's true and then show how that supposition is somehow a buzzard so let's suppose that we actually had laws of society and laws of history that would enable us to predict when there would be wars and revolutions the real problem is this whatever else wars and revolutions are may involve lots of molecule movements but that has the consequence that any strict laws about wars and revolutions what half the match perfectly with the law is about molecule movements in order for a revolution to start on such and such a date the relevant molecules would have to be blowing in the right direction but if that's so that no laws that predict the revolution will have to make the same predictions that the level of revolutions spend their participants that the laws of molecule movements make at the level of the physical particles so now our original question can be reformulated why can't the laws of the higher level by level of revolutions match perfectly with the laws of the lower level the level of particles well to see why they can't let examines in cases where there really is a perfect match between a higher order laws and the lower order lawless and then we can see how these cases differ from the social cases while the all time successes in reducing the lowest at one level to those of a lower level is the reduction of the gas laws wells warned charles la took a loss of statistical mechanics how does the reduction in work big gas flow as concern the relations between pressured temperature in volume of gases they predict free sample that if you increase the temperature to gas in the cylinder you increase the pressure on the walls of the cylinder the laws of statistical mechanics concern debater of masses of small particles they predict for example that if you increase the rate of movement of the particles and aghast mar the particles will hit the walls of the cylinder and will hit them harder now the reason you get a perfect match between these two sets of laws is that the explanation of temperature pressure in volume can be given entirely in terms of the behavior of particles increasing the temperature of the gas increases the velocity that particles and increasing the number in the last to be of the particles hitting the cylinder walls increases the pressure so it follows that any increase in temperature will produce an increase in pressure now suppose for the sake of argument that it wasn't like that suppose there was no explanation of pressure and temperature in terms of the behavior of more fundamental particles then any law set the level of pressure and temperature would be simply miraculous because it would be miraculous that the way that pressure and temperature were calling on the coincided exactly with the way that the particles were going on if there was no systematic relations between the bet haider of the system at the level of pressure and temperature and the behavior of the system at the level of the particles lists examples of very simple case so let's take a slightly more complex example is the law of nutrition science that caloric intake equals cal orrick output plus or minus fat deposits has not ever a fancy law perhaps but it's pretty realistic nonetheless it as a consequence known to most dumbest that if you eat a lot and you don't exercise enough yet get fat now this law alikes aghast lawless is not grounded in a nice simple why in the behavior of the particles to grounding isn't simple because for example as a rather complex series of processes by which food is converted into fat deposits in living organisms battle as there's still a grounding however complex of this law in terms of the behavior of more fundamental particles all the things being equal when yankee alot belmont fuels will be blowing exactly the right direction to make it back what now given easy examples we cannot argue further towards the conclusion that there will be no laws of wars and revolutions in a way that there are laws of gases and of nutrition toughened ,comma in the world that we picked out with concepts like war and revolution married money and property are not grounded systematically in the behavior of the elements of the more basic level in a way that the phenomena that we take out with concepts like fat deposits and pressure are grounded systematically in the behavior of elements that are more basic level but not a question arises if the social and psychological phenomenon are grounded in this way why aren't they like clinton .period the granted that they're not so grounded white act that a school wars and revolutions like everything else consist of molecule movements so why can't set social phenomena as wars and revolutions be systematically related molecule movements in the same way that the relations between calorie imports and fat deposits or systematic but to see why this can't be so we have to ask what features social phenomena have that enable us to bind them into categories what enough fundamental principles on which we categorize psychological and social phenomena won a crucial feature is this for a large number of social and psychological phenomenon that concepts that remains the phenomenon is itself a constituent of the phenomena so in order for something they count as a marriage ceremony or a trade union or property or money or even all war or revolution people involved in these activities have to have certain appropriate thoughts and in general they have to think that's what he is so for example in already get married or buy property you and other people have to think that that's what your dough when bettis feature is crucial to social phenomena but there's nothing like it in the biological and physical sciences something can be a tree europe planter some person come after burke kilo says even if no one thinks hears a tree or hears a plan for this is a case of tuberculosis and even if no one thinks about it at all but to many of the terms that describe social phenomena have to insert into their very constitution and this has the further results that such terms have upbeat cuellar kind of self reference she audi because that money refers to whatever people use it as an think off as money promised refers to whatever people in tenet has been regarded as promises i'm not saying that in order to have the institution of money people have to have that very word or some exact synonym in their vocabulary rather they must have certain thoughts and attitudes about something in order that account is money in these thoughts and attitudes are part of the very definition of money that is another crucial consequence of this feature the defining principles of such social phenomena set no physical limits whenever on what can count has the physical realize they should all of them and this means that there can't be any systematic connections become in the physical and the social or mental properties of the phenomena this social features in question are determined in part by the attitude we take toward them the attitudes we take toward them are not constrained by the physical features of the phenomena in question therefore that can't be any matching of the mental level at the level of the physics of the sort that would be necessary to make strict laws of the social sciences possible so the main step any argument for radical dis continuity became the social sciences and the natural sciences depends on the mental character of social phenomena edited this feature which all those analogies that mentioned earlier that is between meteorology biology and geology neglect the radical disc continuity between the social disciplines on the one and and the natural sciences on the other darius on the role of the mining in the social disciplines can center followers claim that social laws will have exceptions since the phenomenon that the social level map loosely or dust jumped to a plea on to the physical phenomena once again this doesn't account for the radical disc continuity scribe in calling attention to be met if this sort of this junction had been true of up to a certain point it's always open to the next person that they had to redeem you definitely many weights suppose mahdi had always taken a limited range of physical forms gould's silver printed paper for example stale it's open to the next person our society that treats something else's money indeed death physical realization of money doesn't matter to the properties of money as long as the physical realize they shun enables the staff to be used as a medium of exchange well somebody might object to me in order to have our rigorous social science we don't need estrich match between properties of things in the world already does this streak matched bickering this psychological properties and features of the brain to real grounding of economics and sociology in the physical world is not in the properties of objects we find around us is enough physical properties of the brain so even if thanking that something is money is essential to its being money still think king that its money may well be a bead on your own account is a process in the brain so in order to show that there can't be any strict laws of social sciences you have to show that there can't be any strict correlations between mental states membranes state types and you haven't shown that well to see why there can't be said correlations let's examine some areas where it seems likely that we will get a strict merrill psychology that is strict laws correlate ng metcalfe phenomena and narrow physiological phenomenon consider painting for example it seems reasonable to suppose that narrow physiological causes of pains at least in human beings are quite limited and specific indeed we discussed some of them in an earlier lecture this seems to be no obstacle in principle to having a perfect muro physiology of pain but what about save vision well once again it's hard to see any obstacle in principle to getting inadequate narrow physiology of vision we might even get to that point where we could describe perfectly devereaux physiological conditions for having certain sorts of visual experiences experience of seeing that something is rare for instance but now here comes the hard part though we might get systematic correlations between euro physiology and pain or neuro physiology and the visual experience of red we couldn't get similar accounts of the narrow physiology of seeing that something was money for a nap granted that every time you see that there's some money in front of you sound narrow physiological process goes on what step prevented from being the same process every time well from the fact that money can have an indefinite range of physical forms it follows that it can have an indefinite range of stimulus effect on our nervous systems but since it can have an in depth and range of stimulus patterns on our nervous systems need will once again be a miracle if they all produced exactly the same narrow physiological effect on the brink and what dose for seeing that something is money goes even more forcefully for believing that its money it would be nothing short of miraculous if every time someone believed that he was short of money in whatever language and culture he had disbelief in it had exactly the same type of narrow physiological realize they should add that simply because the range of possible neuro physiological stimuli that could produce that very belief is infinite paradoxically the way that the metal infects the physical prevents their ever being a strict sense of the mental noticed that in cases where we do not have this sort of interaction between the social and the physical phenomena this obstacle to having strict social scientists is not present consider the example i mentioned earlier upjohn skis hypothesis of universal grammar set his eat jemison has innately programmed in our brains the rules of universal grammar says these rules are in the brain of birth and independent of any relations the organism has with the environment is nothing in my argument to prevent their being strict psycho physical laws connecting these rules and features of the brain however interrelated and complicated the rules might be well i'd promised to try to give you at least the sketch of a step by step argument let's see how far i got and keeping that promise let's set the argument out as a series of steps stapp won for a debt to the laws of the social sciences in the sense in which there are laws of physics there must be some systematic correlation between phenomenon identified in social and psychological terms and phenomena identified in physical terms it can be as complex as the way the weather phenomena are connected with the phenomena of physics but there has to be some systematic correlation in the contemporary jargon that have to be some bridge principles the trend higher in the lower levels stepped to social phenomena are in large part defined in terms of the psychological attitude that people take what counts is money or a promise or a marriage is in large part a matter of what people think of as money promised our marriage three days as the consequence that these categories are physically open ended their strictly speaking no physical limits to what we can regard as or stipulate that the money or a promise or a marriage ceremony for that implies that there can't be any breach principles became a social and physical features of the world that is between phenomena disk read in social terms and the same phenomena described in physical term herbs we can even have this sort of loose addition junked its principles we have ,comma whether for digestion i've furthermore it's impossible to get the right kind of bridge principles between phenomena describe in mantle's terms and phenomena describe gennaro physiological terms that is between the brain and the mind and this is because there is an indefinite range of stimulus conditions for any given social concept this enormous range prevents concepts that are not built into its from being realized in a way that systematically correlates mental and physical features i lie to conclude his lecture by describing what seems to me the true character of the social sciences the social sciences in general are about various aspects of intentionally economics is about the production and distribution of goods and services noticed that the working economist can simply take intentionally for granted he assumes that entrepreneurs are trout or make money and that consumers would prefer to be better off rather than worse off and the laws of economics than state systematic fallout or consequences of such assumptions given certain assumptions the economists can deduce that a rational entrepreneurs will sell whether marginal cost equals their marginal revenue not noticed that the law doesn't predict that the businessman asks himself m. i. selling where my marginal cost equals my marginal revenue nicole the law does is take the content of the individual intention audi rather get worked out the consequences of such intentional the theory of the firm in micro economics works out the consequences of certain assumptions about the desire some possibilities of consumers and businesses engaging in buying producing and selling macroeconomics works out the consequences of such assumptions for whole all nations and societies sans economics is grounded not in systematic facts about physical properties such as molecular structure in the way that for example chemistry is grounded in systematic facts about molecular structure but rather economics is grounded in fact about human intention audi about desires practices state of technology in states of knowledge it follows that economics cannot be free of history or context economics as the science presupposes certain historical facts about people and societies that are not themselves part of economics and when those facts change economics as the subject has to change for example until recently the phillips curve of formula relating a series of factors in industrial societies seem to get an accurate description of economic realities in those societies well lately it has to work so well i think most economists believe that this is because it didn't accurately describe reality but they might consider perhaps he did accurately describe reality as it was at that time however after the oil crises and various other events of the seventies reality changed the economics is a systematic formalized science but it's not a independent of context or free of history is grounded inhuman practices but those practices are not themselves timeless eternal or inevitable well let's not turn the linguistics this standard contemporaneous of linguistics is the state that area's roles fall allowed a goal sent technique and semantic de relates sounds and meanings in the various natural languages at ideal week complete science of linguistics would give a complete set of rules for every natural human language i'm not sure that this is the right golfer linguistics are remembered its ago it's possible that payment but for the present purposes important thing then note is that it is once again an applied science of intentionally it's not the least like chemistry or geology it's concerned with specifying those historically determined intentional contents in the minds of speakers of the various languages that are actually responsible for human linguistic competence as with economics big eluded bahrain's linguistics together is human intention out to the upshot of this fifth lecture can now be stated quite simply the radical disc continuity between the social and unnatural sciences doesn't come from the fact that has only a disc jockey of connection in social and physical phenomena it doesn't even come from affected social disciplines have constituted concepts which have no echo in physics nor even from the great complexity of social life made disciplines such as geology biology and meteorology have these features but that does not prevent them from being systematic natural scientists know though radical disc continuity derives from the intrinsically metal character of social and psychological phenomena the fact that the social sciences are powered by the mine is the source of their weakness visa be the natural sciences but it's also precisely the source of their strength has social sciences what we will watch from the social sciences at what we get from the social sciences at their best are a series of pure and applied intentionally conditioning took caught costs can meet and i
