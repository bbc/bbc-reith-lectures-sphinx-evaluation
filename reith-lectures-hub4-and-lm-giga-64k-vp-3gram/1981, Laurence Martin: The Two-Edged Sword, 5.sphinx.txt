party back in my first lecture there are really two fundamentally different theories indeed when the united states launch control and disarmament agency was founded in nineteen sixty one day was a major congressional battle over which ordered the turner should take any agencies title this sampler idea though the more radical candidacy for a is that the disarmament by which is usually meant reduction in the quantity or perhaps even the total abolition of armaments this approach has most plausibility if you believe that all elements are the primary and perhaps even the sole source of international conflict then the process of producing arms would becomes self reinforcing and the vicious circle that's why he's supposed to exist in the form of an arms race would be reversed in the

world governments to end four or order to adjudicate disputes and to enact peaceful change this security framework will have to take the continued form of a balance of power this affair as mccloy

depends for its excess on the very armed force that it has tried to control it is therefore essential that the policies adopted in the name of our control do not upset the underlying equitably and control is commonly thought of as a pro sets up negotiating agreed imitations between states because control can be pursued unilaterally raising the idea of our control to prominence as strategic

concepts such as parakeet in one or two but mentions does violence to the bench to see if the pact to strategic problem to treaties were made possible by the development of the satellite born and other methods of reconnaissance is so coarse national technical means in the terms of the treaty's that dispensed with the interests of all the sites methods of inspection to wish to sell a union at

have been largely a magic from the salt persist but because of their indistinct technical characteristics and their entanglement with the regional powers and balance its these difficulties seem far more serious to me that the complaints of american hawks that the united states received a bad date in the treaty's despite a few bias is in favor of the soviet union as in its unique quarter if heavy miss aisles nothing in the treaty's prevents the united states maintaining a better strategic balance if it has the will to do set much more worrying is the possibility that the complexities of the

in europe but a passing occasion when divergent interests coincided just enough for one off deal entering into oversimplified agreements about particular aspects of a complex strategic environment where politics and technology interaction ever changing patterns in tells the danger of inducing the flexibility with which to adapt to change the prejudice against technological innovation especially western innovation to which i referred on an earlier occasion offers a more generalized illustration called this danger this prejudice is turning west ended that policy into a series of running fights

but get ross left i want to suggest that its undoubted potential cut only be realized by providing a sound and realistic footing if the inherent limitations of arms control are ignored that the defects of specific proposals may be too light be dismissed on the grounds that the ultimate prize of the disarmed a world justifies a few risks this is happening with the current negotiations over kevin into weapons with yet a double vision of a europe free from nuclear danger and even a europe with no nuclear weapons based in it would not be back with this vision foster's and critical enthusiasm for any intermediate proposed policies labeled and control should be scrutinized as carefully as any other proposal to adjust the knowledge of ballots equally however we should not reject an aunt control measure merely because it is modest or not simplistic the accord with the idea off disarmament indeed i believe that as people come to appreciate the difficulty of reconciling the intel complexity of lamott merlot to see with the oversimplification and rigidity often required by diplomatic negotiations we may see a shift in our control firm bought me my colt inputs to outputs we begin to realize that it is less important exactly what weapons the enemy hands that are locked in a bid to ease baby right from so long as a nuclear power does not have a clear for a strike in

with the negotiated ceilings on armaments is the fourth ring stepped in this direction in europe the shift in the force reduction talks from foreseeing must to one record confidence building measures may be another such move than a candidacy that the idea of our control has conferred on asian national dialogue about such matters is one of its most valuable contributions to making the millet should balance safer perhaps the most important contribution of all is to disseminate the white sands of portion and restraint in confrontations between the nuclear power is this sets a course is the strong but narrow bases on which the nuclear weapon may yet enable us to build strategic moderation more for money that opry disasters this sense of confidence and mutual understanding which may exist between accessories for the purpose of a pretty catastrophe will do so however only if we do not allow the rhetoric of arms control to make a snug decked the underlying balance of power that creates our common interest in the first blast the courtroom that harsh control requires and facilitates needs to be observed as much in avoiding complacency as in avoiding provocation it then listening to
