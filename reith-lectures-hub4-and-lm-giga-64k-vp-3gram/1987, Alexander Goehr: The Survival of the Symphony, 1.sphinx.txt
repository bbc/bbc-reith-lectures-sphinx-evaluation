hope to which he met as peace and prosperity shared around the planet it beat we all sense that we are a very important decision points in the planet's and with obvious risks than with huge opportunities and sue just said there is no place on the planet of more significance for these choices for its of owning segment as well as for the world say to that as china today it contradicted every single way your calls for superlatives units or roll its dimensions saluted and of the states for the world here we are in a famous and beautiful magnificent hall of the big ten thousand to the

people of this country to country so fast that of course ,comma it is one fifth of the world's population and quickly becoming a u. absolut is center of global economy as well as many of the challenges that will discuss tonight not only use it the world's most populous country is one of the world's most crowded countries and it is certainly one of them mostly bar mentally spurs arrests regions of the world i call my lectures that today's yet for the seat eight term deduce a una spectacular of lee's visit aid permitted invented by one of the great scientists of our age paul kreutz and to signify the fact that human beings for the first time have taken hold not only of an economy or our population but a very physical systems of the planet itself and from the scene of meeting human created etiquette are known for is for its history the geologists call are high in the whole scene that's the purity of the last thirteen thousand years or so since the last ice age recruits in why sweetened perhaps other shockingly noted that the last two hundred years are relieved that you need that they not only in human history but in the physical purchase history as well yet for dizziness that purity when human activities has overtaken vast parts of the natural cycles on the planet and has done so we in ways that the range the cycles and that fundamentally threaten asked indeed in the years ahead of considering how we're going to face the dual challenge of seed continued economic progress which we dearly hope for getting this concrete ended all or parts of the developing world and continued economic well being of course and progress in today's already friday ,comma world how we can combine that economical weedy profile indignity growing in farm apple dangers that we face is the subject of our reflections today what absolutely striking and paul's always needs a self is the basic facts are as follows while we are already doing on the planet in terms of the facts and physical systems is literally unsustainable week could not go on doing what we're doing so we have already reached a point to both literal and sustainability is sensitive weekend team you're on our current path using resources the way we use them now that the scale we use them now we would be a case very harsh boundaries that would do great damage to human wellbeing to the physical or any two vast numbers literally millions of other species on the planet bought we haven't even harder problem to solve the now one and that is we don't want to stop your in terms of where we are urging consumption or economic activity to develop a hunt treason worrying the most populous and call them but the developing world which is why six inhumanity right to leave and understandably says they would like their flay said the site as well if the i. a. ,comma world has achieved income levels and comfort levels profitability of safety and life expectancy of a vast proportions will one about the rest of humanity and from my point of view is that a ballot economist's something absolutely water full is happening something that i think we could get it all at the age of convergence and that is the measure of economic development the methods the institutions that processes the agitation of advanced technologies is becoming a worldwide phenomenon now tragically not every part of the world as yet part of that phenomenon and i will have the chance to discuss that in a later lecture when we talk about the poorest of the four were still not part of this dynamism but wonderful loses that large parts of the planet are part of its dynamism china is of course to the very forefront most dramatically ended on a precedent that matter catching up in technology economic activity human wellbeing and let's not golf the improvements of living not only don't know it can then choi measured living standards but acumen wellbeing and white expectancy victory should get opportunities in chances to fulfill lights hopes that ,comma along with his economic improvement and the process is now are powerful through the powerful wheeze of globalization to market forces futility of ideas and technology to flow cross national boundaries and a precedent to great so we have the world economy now growing at approximately five percent proud of and that is up four percent of approximately of per capita aidid ,comma decreases and one percent per year broccoli of the global population increased but that he is we are on course for a massive decrease of economic activity just what's we would like to see getty still poor countries of the world those who aspired to happy chances of that technology in science have brought us any is fair to say that given current trends we have a powerful forces of the economic convergence in most parts of the world and gives the processes of convergence continue operating as they had in recent decades one could expect that perhaps the average per person a calm on the planet could rise as much as four times between now and the century population of course no increasing more slowly in proportional terms than it did in the second half of the twentieth century is still increasing in absolute terms by an astounding amount of seventy two with eighty million people per year and in a medium forecast only you when population division that leads to a projection of of roughly eight garuda increase of another two when a half billion people on the planet by your twenty fifty raw wheat population increasing by eight close to fifty percent eat ,comma and a half bari disasters of various kinds to decrease proximate lee fourfold multiplying wanted a half times for suggests that the current economic trajectory would lead to a decrease of world economic activity of six times between now and twenty fifty now that's the bull from the point of view of economic development but think about the paradox it already we are in eight lead early and unsustainable trajectory and yet china india large parts of asia are successfully barreling ahead now we have unprecedented leave rapid economic development were asking sol are planted to absorb eighty many fully increase of economic activity in top posts in already existing degree of gunfire mental stress that we never before seen on the planet of course we'd actually courted not do this we would not be able to decrease sixfold in economic activity ,comma are current technologies before the fire metal catastrophes would literally choke off this economic growth back arch should speed water stressed before station owner or the various parts of the world species extinction would cause this projection to go over arrived even before we were able to do such grave damage on the planet but that does pose the fundamental question what will give a kidney and now many people think the only state that he views it is the living standards and high income world and some council that they will have to be crushed where his father is a bullied fit we are falling for the bitter struggle between the rich and poor in the years ahead i want to argue with that their use the only way for peacefully body heat is a viable way for an daddy's a changing of the wheat we would've that allows for continued improvement of living standards in all parts of the world that allows for the aspirations of catching up but doesn't also permit us to square the circle of environmental stress and economic development now what can we do does it mean that any economic growth does it needs to ended the hopes of the developing world doesn't need dallaire ,comma packs of living conditions adaptable get today's rich world idle lead that there is another course and it's a course we must take there are at least three ways out of this conundrum furst of course he's why use fuel efficiency in energy efficiency so that we can get more economic output we last direct use of fossil fuels sat a golf course is the substitution of not fossil fuels for the fossil fuel so that per unit of energy the nations of carbon dioxide can be reduced whether it's nuclear power safely deployed for or economical solar power for windows or biomass there's definitely a role though perhaps not as dramatic as we might hope for a substitution of a non fossils he rules for today's heavy dependence more than eighty percent of our commercial energy use there's a third alternative as well and that is to learn to use our existing fossil fuels safely and for trying out an eightieth this is perhaps the single most important call for peace countries and for the planet one idea on the drawing board which needs to get the two demonstration of production in this country as soon as possible and that means nearly immediately is the idea of power plants which burn coal to generate electricity capturing the carbon dockside that they would otherwise admit palm mediated of pipelines and pumping it eighty to the euro because state geologic reservoirs now that the question for the planet and unprecedented challenge to move to weigh sustainable energy system requiring eight degree of cooperation and foresight and planning any time dimension of decades can we do what can we find that that level of public understanding political consensus direction and determination we may take it with a nice beaches but the climate will change whether we stated or not there is no state aid this one is one of these depended not on what we actually do not what we say we do now very quickly i want to mention one hopeful analogies and that the use hollow we have successfully as a world avoided what seemed to be another and was another desperate risk and now it was the depletion of the ozone layer it was discovered by paul fruits and you'd scientist who brought us the chance for the c. e. challenge a bozo is well he and two colleagues sure when brolin did mario molina discovered accidentally as it were dated each capitals the we use for refrigeration and for our aerosols that klar floor carpets the c. f. c. east posed a grave risk to survive on the planet because of their accidental interactions in the stratosphere that quoted had destroyed the ozone layer yu was an accidental discovery of brilliant science it took some euro for the public to be aware that when the scientists said that the neighbors of the c. s. c. said it best in science we fertile for their work adding to the guy asked but betty massif in united states to snap the picture from one of its remarkable satellites show when a hole in the ozone layer in a way it made a good picture that saved the world this is soon as people sought out whole what they're all ties they weren't listening to the chairman of dupont anymore they were feeding about their survival in the survival of their children to public awareness sorted that pressure for action decreased at appoint dupont and other companies scientists went to work on a determined there was an alternative to the c. f. c.'s door all are safer ,comma schools that could be heard for jurists that could be a deodorant cast bigot beady aerosols not surprising after all they found them and a fourth stapp took place a whispered in the years of the politicians he so paid you could reach an international agreement we can handle this and quickly actually remarkably quickly from the basic science to the international agreements took about fifteen years and by nineteen ninety eight global framework was in place that called for the phasing out of the chlorofluorocarbons and discord is ,comma pap balk at least relative safety with regards to that risk with climate i believe we have the same hopes now a much more difficult issue eight problem dating gets to the core of the functioning of the world economy so one that cannot be solved from one aide to the next requiring eight basic change of heart infrastructure are energy systems which will take decades to complete but process nonetheless that aidid is under way in the same way first a new science back in eighteen ninety six and that of modern science in the last twenty five years and as soon as the science kane came the companies would investigate for saint john's science because vast dairy state start lobbying but you don't lobby against nature nature passage principles it doesn't matter what the boards of these companies say what matters is the actual physical mechanisms to science was right hedy comes more and more known now why he bozo crisis public awareness has been the second stapp for along time climate change was discussed as something for the far future now woods understood assaulting him kurland asked today as well be the way to europe in two thousand three claiming more than twenty thousand lives for a cut tree out aids stormont devastating proportion shopping the american people and the world about what climate can do the nagging drought in australia that took place this year and destroyed a substantial part of australia's export crop that massive typhoons being experienced by this country as well as the warming taking place in large part of this country and severe droughts in the curator of china have all made the climate change at immediate issue it understandable issue and one bit of courses will get worse that could use is the scientists and engineers are now scurrying technological alternatives are being developed carded capturing seed west ration is beginning to be put to induct lacy demonstration projects so to alternative not fossil fuel energy source says and sold to remarkable breakthroughs in energy efficiency such as hybrid and plugging a hybrid automobiles would promise last of vastly more efficient automobiles so more of my wood should per kilometer or my dope driven bid good news is that those technological breakthroughs are similarly leading the company still whisper in the years of the politicians it so katie we can handle this and ask the best news of all the companies around the world are now in the league of their politicians in fact they're telling the politicians we half act we while a framework we needed incentive mechanism we need a price structure so that we can move ahead we sustainable energy and a lead for good against their we'd only global negotiations on a truly global framework exists elmer up this year in bali indonesia weaker greeted principle on a framework convention on climate change that we must stabilize greenhouse gases we took it up early small step in the so called kyoto protocol but his only follow the varied small set of commitments for a limited part of the world may lead europe because the united states did not beat detroit now when december wheat masa happy you west and china any yet and the european union and other parts of the world all coming together and saying we must do this for ourselves and for the future nature has spoken more loudly investigate truce this is not a matter of vested interests this is a matter of common interest the staff's from the science to the public awareness to the technological alternatives to the international agreements are the very steps that we will need even for all aspects of piano for a seat this will leave a mark of our new hero science based global policy making peacetime worldwide public awareness basket to be true for saving the rain forests for seating at aro shoes from overfishing for managing water stress and for choosing population alternatives that are sound for the planet and sound for the individuals as well we don't happen to which sapped the population trends because people would choose fertility reduction voluntarily in large parts of the developing world that the alternatives are made available to them in their individual choices as well weekend who this and we will learn that the costs of action are tiny in fact compared to the risks of the inaction climate change can be solved according to the best current estimates for less than one percent of world economic aid each year and perhaps well under that were the potential costs are but devastating multiple of several percent of world income if we continue on to business as usual trajectory are wanting an aged where i started the first lecture with my favorite speech of president john kennedy he talked about the challenge of peace that he is our biggest challenge on the planet and peace is also threatened by environmental risk but he also told us in that speech that we have chances he said it and i repeat because i think the use our common thread our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by a man and man can be as big as he walks no problem human destiny is beyond human beings

aren't speaking to thank you the choice that sometimes puts economics versus the environment to use largely misstated the date the part it is part of the economic well being it's knocking contrast economic well being not let the state did choices that we actually based on how to use land how the fish are how to use our energy resources are less dire and less painful than we think if we will closely and are real opportunities especially with technology i talked about the new kinds of sustainable energy systems that we can adopt at relatively low cost but when the talk about another massive overfishing of the oceans leading to a disruption of the fisheries china is the pioneer now had a global scale than alternative cox hope coulter so massive fish farming and china viewed farms of perhaps eighty to ninety percent of all the world's fish farming out that's a technology farming to fish rather than depleting the oceans that gives us hope that it's not his mind cresson is that

the cost of this are not the state to the chinese people you will not achieve economic development board to the american people for that matter purity ,comma levels will be deeply undermined know that's the point the point is if we mobilize our science and technology well if we prove that demonstrated the fumes carbon captured seats was rationed or other technologies will find that we can why

environmentalists don't and you said that one of the keys in a resting its case public advocacy in other words giving people the voids so those people can keep governments in the big companies ,comma it's bad as you well know china is known to be paid in giving people a voice is that soft a government at the central level as of the very keen understanding of the environmental issues but often at local levels governments are corrupt and that in bed with the big cruising companies so what would you say it isn't remotely possible that china will have grown island off pluralism enough public advocacy and enough democracy to solve the environmental problems that you are outlined it is not always remote leaf or possible i think it's very likely in fact he's gunfire mental challenges salute

daughter we are seeing the change with the just the last three or four years of public awareness not because of period not because of lectures but because of what is he felt the daily lives i've had excellent discussions with the chinese leadership over the last year ,comma these issues they are fully aware of this and i believe that this is going to be the realization he this concrete in a yet

have seen it selling its competitions i agree that the central government than at the big and laments that they realized the big problems but do what what i've seen in many other generous to go around the country is seen time and time again is that local governments do not obey the central government and they are corrupt and then all sinking about the planet to think about their own short term

i'm glad not to mention in today's ward of globalized issue we need more cooperation on the global m. barman and governance we are running a national water pollution database on recently when we clapton is stoked water polluters and we came across a field in a sixty seven to multinational companies from japan from us from euro and they will call by the local agencies of violating the basic

need to be understood in a dynamic process deuce accusing go down to the flight for new ways of doing things in this country and in the world many of the examples is that it had been given could've

with pieces polluting or resource depleting activities adequately and therefore we need to be collective action did countervailing sta market i am not arguing that for one gate to the next we're going

is being changed what we are also in a process of tremendous global recognition and rise of understanding of this just in a short period of time aidid will predicts that by twenty ten we have a pulse kyodo agreement reached one that has included paul conferees china and the united states' european union and others that the greek to targets that are serious about heading off this kind of environmental passed in two years' time china and the humans will warn the meat to the doubts what i said i'll say it again i fully fit by what he had we will have a post kyodo global agree on what needs to be delighted if he didn't do you have what it has to be a honeymoon in the got -hyphen i don't know what i'm predicting it and i know that i hadn't heard anything yet ,comma the bases of the party that haitians benign aid which is that easy issues dole from the site and to the public awareness to the technological options to the agreements and i think we're getting that phase right now are actually what's different about ron numb not only by saying things are changing and actually putting a date on it as well i believe that by twenty ten we will have an agreement by the league could be more specific that every major presidential candidate in the united states for its apple in the two thousand eight election will have a strong climate change plan so will see that in real time whether a crime of right or merely dreman wrecking the reason i believe that this is happening is that the scientific consensus is sound because the major oil companies are actually running advertisements every day in the global press about the dangers of climate change now solving has changed ,comma for the better and that's a good point in this he and anything can jonathan book seized the golan in correspondence hitting southeast asian towns nucor things here ,comma i came back today from in front which is the possibility is being declared as the most polluted city of hope from the conde it was particularly horrible but the message was contradictory villas on one side the local government said that they were going to close down a hundred and sixty of a hundred blazing allying pliant foundries which says it has huge said that there is more environment awareness here on the other side of most local people said we don't believe the government we don't trust the media that people is that you said we could get in trouble if we speak to another is that we don't want this environmental we taught changes we have no way of affecting government policy summit question is this peace is still have one policy dictates a ship what you think is the role rudolph public accountability in improving the environment and if i could just get devils aptitude in some ways when they do best in the free -hyphen agreeing to take to ship to solve the world's problems rather than agreeing democracy will i think the public accountability is extremely important but the problem is in sight of these foundries he's not the problem of one political system it's a problem of low pulpit but ,comma he hit his true when the united states for trying out for that many other places where you have the local economy depending on the probably defunct technology at this point that is built up the set of jobs in an environmentally unsustainable manner and that is a top challenger anywhere so one needs a set of instruments and institutions to provide either alternatives to wealth retrofit factories to providing compensation for the fire mental adjustments and so forth in a lot of those institutions don't exist in this country because the challenges are awaiting faced right now for the first time that the p. c. could see was how important is democracy holds some and i think that democracy in china and its media think them op i agree that most of what he said but i think you do kind of coats of that question that has so many foreign leaders and four businessmen coming to china not to his will want to live in human rights and most citizens of other things on it late their auto from other people during what can and are immensely season punchy knows he may get a win quinta multicolored think they would like malt pools today would influence government policy and in the schools in the last world than the free media and puts them base things we still are happy to learn that suggests how important is to maintain democracy to china's development in your view i think that china will become more democratic overtime and i think that china will be calm as i say any centralized over time as well this is the date for both the developments taking place and are already apparent in this country if one has any sense of change that's taking place this is already happening and it's happening to the goal it and i'd really don't believe for that outsiders ,comma a u. n. meeting civil claims so it really helps the process i do believe that china's politics are for the chinese people and i believe that these changes will come they will be china's interests they will be the world's interest but the way to the world should best handled this is to help china toward cheated schools tend to find global ,comma points of the meeting and global challenges like climate like a global security because these are the ways that we can build trust build understanding
