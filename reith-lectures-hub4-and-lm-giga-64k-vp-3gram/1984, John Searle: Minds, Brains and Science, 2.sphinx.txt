this is a taut cost and the talk i sit at the b. c. to take tests this late in the series and my aim is the brains and signed skip them by jill sell was a russian april coast in nineteen eighty full denial last lecture i provided at least the outlines of a solution to the so called mind body problem mental processes are caused by the behavior of elements of the brain at the same time there realized in a structure that made up of those elements now i think this answer is consistent with standard biological approaches the biological phenomena however it's very much a minority porno view the prevailing view in philosophy psychology in artificial intelligence is one which emphasizes the analogies between the functioning of the human brain and the functioning of digital computers according to the most extreme version of its few dobrinja is just a digital computer at the mine is just a computer program what mike's summarized as you might call it strong artificial intelligence or strong a. i. u. by saying that the mai india's to the brain as the program is to the computer hardware this view as the consequence that there's nothing essentially biological about the human mind the brain just happens to be one of the new indefinitely large number of different kinds of hardware computers that could sustain the programs which make up human intelligence and su hedy physical system one ever that had the right program with the bright inputs and outputs would have a mind in exactly the same sense that you and i have minds so free sample if you made a computer out of old beer cans powered by windmills if it had the right program it would have to have a mining and the point is not good for all we know what it might have thoughts and feelings but rather it must have thoughts and feelings because of that school there is the hemmings thoughts and feelings implementing the right program now most people hold this if you think we have not yet designed programs which our minds that this pretty much general agreement among them that it's all a matter of time into computer scientists and workers in artificial intelligence designed the appropriate hardware programs which will be the equivalent of human brains and minds of many people outside the field of artificial intelligence are quite amazed to discover that anybody could believe such a view is this so before criticizing it let me give you a few examples of the things that people in this field have actually said herbert simon of carnegie mellon university says that we already have machines that can literally think well fancy fact philosophers have been a word for centuries about whether or not a machine could think and now we discover that they've already got such machines at carnegie mellon simonds colleague alan dole claims that we have now discovered and noticed that mills says discovered and not just hypothesized are considered the possibility that actually discovered that intelligence is just a matter of physical symbol manipulation it has no essential connection with any kind of biological or physical wet where or hardware both simon and alter their credit emphasize it does nothing metaphorical about these claims they mean them quite literally marvin minsky of m. i. t. says that the next generation of computers will be so intelligent that we will be a rocky affair willing to keep us around the house as household pets but by all time favored no literature exaggerated claims on behalf of the digital computer is from john mccarthy the inventor of the term artificial intelligence mccarthy says he found a machine as simple as a thermostat can be said to have bowl leaks and indeed almost hit a machine capable of problem solving can be sent to have beliefs i end my mccarthy's carriage i once asked him what believes there's your thermostat half henney said my thermostat has three boat wakes it believes it's too hot in here it's too cold in here and it's just right in here now as if basra like always claims for a simple reason unlike most philosophical theses they're reasonably clean air and they can be simply and decisively refuted it this reputation that i am going to undertake in this lecture that nature of their reputation has nothing whatever to do with any particular stage of computer technology i think it's import emphasize that because in these discussions the temptation is always to think that the solution to our problems must await on some as yet been created technological wonder but in fact been major reputation is completely independent of any state of technology it has to do with the very definition of a digital computer with what the digital computer is its essential to our conception of the digital computer that its operations can be specified purely formal betty's we specified missteps in the operation of a computer in terms of abstract symbols sequences of zeros and ones printed on it take for example it tobago computer rolled will determine that whenever she is in a certain state that it has a certain symbol on its tape that it will perform a certain operations such as erasing the symbol or printing another symbol and then enter another state such as moving to take one square to laughed but this symbols have no meaning they have no semantic content that knocked out by old anything they have to be specified purely in terms of their formal orson tactical structure this hero settle ones are just numerals they are even stanford who numbers indeed get the best feature of digital computers that makes them so powerful one in the same type of hardware if it's appropriately designed can be used to run any definite range of different programs and one in the same program can be run on an indefinite range of different types of hardware its but with this feature of programs that they're defined purely formally orson tactically is fatal to the view that mental processes and program processes are identical and the reason can be stated quite simply does more to having a mining bed having formal oars and tactical processes are eternal mental states by definition have certain sorts of contents if unthinking ambac kansas city or wishing that i had a cold beer to drink are wondering if there will be a fall in interest rates in each case my mental state has a certain metal content in addition to whatever formal features that might have that he is even if my thoughts eckerd emmy and strings of symbols dumbest be more to the thought that the abstract strains because spring is by themselves can have any meaning if my thoughts are to beat up balcony things than the strings must have a meeting which makes the thoughts about those things hillard behind as more than a syntax it as a semantics now other resigned but no computer program can ever be a mine in is simply that a computer program used only seem practical and mines are more than syntax pickle mines are semantic all in this sense that they have more than a formal structure they have a content not to illustrate his point and designed a certain thought experiment imagine that a bunch of computer programmers have written a program that will enable a computer to simulate the understanding of chinese so though free sample if the computer is given a question in chinese it will match the question against its memory your database and produce appropriate answers to the question in chinese suppose the sake of argument that the computer is a answers are as good as those of an eighty chinese speaker now then does the computer on the basis of this understand chinese that it literally understand chinese in the way the chinese speakers understand china well imagine that you are locked in a rome ended in this room are several baskets full of chinese symbols imagine that you like me do not understand a word of chinese but that you're given our rule book in english for manipulating these chinese symbols the rules specify the manipulations of the symbols purely formally in terms of their syntax knock their semantics so rule might say take s. squiggles squiggles signed on a basket number one and put it next to a squabble squabble signed from basket number two now suppose that some other chinese symbols are passed into the room and that you're given further roles for passing back chinese symbols out to the role suppose that unknown to you this symbols passed into the room are called questions by the people outside the room and the symbols you passed back out of the room are called answers to questions suppose furthermore that the programmers are so good at designing the program and that you are so good at manipulating this symbols that very soon your answers are indistinguishable from those of a native chinese speakers there you are a lot tenure rome shuffling your chinese symbols and passing out chinese symbols in response to a incoming chinese symbols on the basis of this situation as i have described it there's no way you could learn in a chinese simply by manipulating these formal symbols now other point of this whole story is simply this by virtue of implementing up formal computer program you back paid exactly as if you understood chinese but all is same you'd don't understand a word of chinese eats but now it's going through the appropriate computer program for understanding chinese is not enough to get you an understanding of chinese then it's not enough to give any other digital computer and understanding of chinese and again the reason for this can be stated quite simply if you don't understand chinese than all other computer could understand chinese because no digital computer just by virtue of running up program has anything that you don't have all but the computer has is that you have a formal program for manipulating an interpreted chinese symbols to repeat a computer as a sin tax but no semantics behold point of the parable of the chinese roman is to run minus of the fact that we knew all along understanding a language already having mental states that all involves more than having just formal symbols it involves having an interpretation or a meeting that cash to those symbols and a digital computer as defined in cannot have more than just formal symbols because the operation of a computer as i said earlier that only be defined in terms of its ability to implement programs and these programs are purely formally specify double bed is they have no semantic content i think we can see the force of this argument deeply contrast what it's like to be asked and then answer questions in english and to be asked and answered questions and some language where we have no knowledge of any the meanings of the words imagined that in the chinese room euro also given questions in english about such things as your age or your life history and that you answer these questions now what's the difference between the chinese case in the english case well again if like me you understand no chinese than you do understand english but that difference is obvious you understand the questions because they're expressed the symbol whose meanings are known to you sell only when you get the answers in english or producing symbols which are meaningful to you that in the case to the chinese have not had that in the case of the chinese use simply manipulate formal samples according to a computer program and you attach no meaning to any of the elements belfast replies have been suggested to this argument by workers in artificial intelligence and psychology as well as philosophy they all have something in common they are old inadequate and has an obvious reason why they have to be inadequate since the argument rests on a very simple logical troops namely syntax alone is not sufficient for semantics and digital computers insofar as their computers have by definition this impacts alone are what make this clear by considering a couple of the arguments that are often presented against me some people attempt to answer that chinese room example by saying that dot whole system understands chinese the idea here is that dole id of the person in the roman nippy awaiting the samples do not understand chinese i'm just a central processing unit of the computer system and they argued that it's the whole system including the road to the baskets full assembles the ledgers containing the programs of crabs other items as well take it as a totality that understands chinese but this is subject to exactly the same objection i made before this no way that the system can get from this impacts to the semantics i a. as the central processing unit have no way of figuring out what he knew the symbols means but then neither does the whole system and other common response is to imagine that we put the chinese understanding program insider robot if the robot moved around in interacted cars only with the world wouldn't that be enough to guarantee that it understood chinese once again the inmate is our ability of the semantic seemed packs distinction and overcomes this maneuver as long as we suppose that the robot has only got a computer for a brain that even though it might babe exactly as if it understood chinese it would still have no way of getting from this impacts to the semantics of chinese eats you can see this if you imagine once again that i am that computer inside a room in the robot's skoal ice shop full symbols without knowing that some of them coming to me from television cameras attached to the robot's head and others go out to move the robot's arms and legs as long as all i have is a formal computer program i have no way of attaching any meaning to any of the symbols so i suppose the robot picks up a hamburger and miss triggers the symbol for hamburger to comment on the rome will as long as all i have is the symbol with no knowledge of its clauses or how it got there i have been no way of knowing what it means the clause only interactions between the robot and the rest of the world are here in relevant unless those causal interactions are represented and some nine or other but there's no way they can be if all that the so called mind consists of is a set of purely formal seem tactical operations its import to see exactly what is claimed in what is not claimed by my argument suppose we ask that question that i mentioned at the beginning could emaciated think well and what a sense of course we're all machines we can construe this stop inside our heads as kmiec machine had of course we can all think so trivial e. there are machines that can think of but that was really the question that bothered us so let's try a different formulation of a court and artifact thanked clem manmade machine think well once again they depend on a kind of artifact suppose we design a machine that was a molecule for molecule indistinguishable from a human being well and that you can duplicate that causes you can presumably duplicate the effects so once again the answer to that question is the principal at least trivial e. yes if you could build a machine that had the same structure as a human being than presumably that machine would be able to think indeed it would be a surrogate human being well strike in the questioning isn't kana machine think or cannot artifact think the question is can add digital computer fake but now once again we have to be very careful in how we interpret the question from a mathematical point of view anything whatever can be described as if it were a digital computer and that's because it can be described as instead sheeting work implementing a computer program so it entirely trivial sends dependence on the desk in front of me can be described as a digital computer it just happens to have a very boring computer programmer the programs has stayed there now seems in this sense anything whatever is the digital computer because anything whatever can be described as implementing a computer program that once again our question gets that trivial lancer of course our brains are digital computers since they implement the mean number of computer programs and of course our brains can think so what began as a the trivial answered the question but that wasn't really the question we want to ask that question we want it to ask is this tenant digital computer as defined think that is to say it against angie aiding or implementing the right computer program with a right inputs and outputs sufficient for work constituted of sinking and the answer to this question and like its predecessors is clearly no any snow further reason that we have spelled out mainly the computer program is defined purely son tactically but think king is more than just a matter of manipulating meaningless symbols it involves a meaningful semantic contents the semantic contents are what we mean by meaning it's imported emphasize again that we're not talking about a particular stage of computer technology my argument has nothing to do with the forthcoming amazing advances in computer science no doubt we will be much better able to simulate human behavior on computers that we can at present has certainly much better than we have been able to win the past but the point i'm making is that if we're talking about having mental states having a mind all these simulations are simply hear relevant it doesn't matter how good the technology used or how rapid the calculations made by the computer are if it's really a computer its operations have to be defined in tactically were as consciousness thoughts feelings emotions at all are restive and involve more than s. index those features by definition that computer use unable to duplicate however powerful may be its ability to simulate the key distinction here is between duplications in simulation and no simulation by its self ever constitutes duplications what i do i was so far is to give a basis to this sense that those quotations i began to stalk with are really as preposterous as they seem but visit paddling question in this discussion and that is why what the body ever have thought that computers could thing gore have feelings and emotions in all arrested in after all we can do computer simulations of it in a process that all they can be given a formal description so we can do a computer simulation of the flow of money in the british economy or the pattern of power distribution in the labor party weekend of computer simulations of rainstorms in the home counties are where house fires in east london now in each of these cases nobody supposes that the computer simulation is actually there are real thank no one supposes that a computer simulation of a storm will leave a sole whacks work computer simulation of a fire is likely to burn the house panel why honor it with anyone in his right mind suppose a computer simulation of mental processes actually hat mental processes i don't really know the answer to that says the idea seems to me to put it frankly quite crazy from the start but i have a couple of speculations first of all wear them eyeing his concern that a lot of people are still tempted to some sort of behavior is some base think if the system behaves as if it understood chinese that then it really must understand chinese but we've already refuted this form of behavior isn't with the chinese room argument another assumption made by many people is that the mind is not part of the biological world it's not up part of the world of nature the strada artificial intelligence view reliance on that in its conception that the mind is purely formal that somehow or other it cannot be treated as a concrete product of biological processes like any other biological prado there is any discussions in short necktie to residual delays some ai partisans believe that the mind is more than a part of the natural biological world they believe that the mind is pure week formally specify apple in apparent acts of this is that the u. a. e. i. literature is filled with alma nations against soundview called duo as an but in fact the whole thesis of strong a. i. rests on a kind of dole as some it rests on our rejection of the idea that the mine is just a natural biological phenomenon in the world like any other i want to conclude this lecture but putting together the thesis of the last lecture to the thesis of this one both of these feces can be stated very simply and indeed i'm going to state that would perhaps excessive krupa nest but if we put them together i think we get it quite powerful conception of the relations of minds brings in computers and e. i. n. s. a very simple logical structure so you can see whether it's valid are invalid in fact you might want a jot down the premise east and the conclusions of this argument the first premise is brains caused my means well of course that's really too crude what we mean by that is the mental processes that we consider to constitute a moneyed are caused buddies in car early caused by processes going on inside the brain but lets the crew lets just write that down as three words brains claus minds and that's just the fact about how the world works now let's write proposition number two seed attacks he is not sufficient for semantics that proposition is a conceptual truth it just articulate our distinction between the notion of what is purely formal and what has content not to these two propositions that brains cause minds ten that syntax is not sufficient for semantics let's add a third ,comma fourth third computer programs are entirely defined by their formal bourse and tactical structure that proposition i take it is true by definition it's part of what we mean by that notion of a computer program alexandra opposition for minds have mental contents specifically they have semantic contents and that i take it is just an obvious fact about how our minds work now from these four premise c.'s weekend draw power first conclusion and a foul is obviously firmed to three and four namely hisses conclusion one no computer program by its self is sufficient to give us this ,comma my aunt programs in short par not mines and they're not by themselves sufficient for having market now that's a very powerful conclusion because it means that the project of trying to create mines solely by designing programs is doomed from the start this is a purely formal or logical result from a set maxey and which are agreed to buy up all or nearly all of the dispute is concerned that its even the most hardcore enthusiast for artificial intelligence agrees that in fact as a matter of biology brain processes cause mental states and they agree that programs are defined purely son tactically but if you put these conclusions together was certain are the things that we know that it follows immediately that the project of strong ai he's incapable of fulfillment however once we've got these acts eons lets see what else we can derive hears a second conclusion the way it had brain functions close mines cannot be solely in virtue of running a computer program and the second conclusion follows from the first premise as well as from march first conclusion that is from the fact that brains cause minds and that programs are not enough to do that job it follows that the way that brains claus minds can't be solely by running a computer program now that also i think is an important result because it had the consequence that the brain is not for at least is not just a digital computer we soccer earlier that anything can be trivia we described as if it were a digital computer and brains are no exception but the importance that this conclusion is that the computational properties of the brain are simply not enough to explain its functioning to produce mental states envied that ought to seem a commonsense scientific conclusion to west anyway because of all eight does is remind us of the fact that brains are biological engines there biology matters it's not as several people in artificial intelligence have claimed it's not just an irrelevant fact about the mind that happens to be realized in human brains not for my first premise we can also derive a third conclusion in the same bells that caused the mines one half to have caused all powers at least the equivalent to those of the brain and this third conclusion is that trivial consequence of our first premise it a bit like saying that if mike petrol engine drives my current seventy five miles an hour then in a diesel engine that was capable of doing that would have to have the power output at least equal went to that of my petrol engine of course some other system might cause mental processes using entirely different chemical or biochemical features from those that the brain infect uses it might turn out that there be a gains on other planets are in some other solar system that have mental state spent yet use an entirely different biochemistry from hours supposed that martians arrived on earth and we concluded that they had mental states but separate that when their heads were opened up it was discovered that all they had inside was green slime well stale back green slime if it functioned to produce consciousness in all the rest of their mental life would have to have causal powers equal to those of the human brain but not from our first conclusion that programs are not enough and our third conclusion that any other system would have to have caused all powers equal to the brain conclusions for follows immediately for many artifact that we might build which had mental state sequel into human mental states seek implementation of a computer program would not by itself be sufficient rather the artifact would have to have powers equivalent to the powers of the human brain the upshot of this entire discussion i believe it is true minus of something that we've known all along namely mental states are biological phenomena consciousness intentional in eight subjectivity and mental causation are all a part of our biological life history along with a gross reproduction the secretion of bio and digestion and listening to caught costs can meet and i said that the b. c. beat a chance to mold outposts to snatch a to b. b. c. don't tend to
