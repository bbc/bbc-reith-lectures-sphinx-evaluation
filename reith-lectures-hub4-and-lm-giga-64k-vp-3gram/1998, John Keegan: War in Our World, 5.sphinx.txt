peking union if he and his unit that's the case to court peking university is the fifth time the b. b. c. has accorded to be connected in china and we couldn't be in a war that could create a spot to more than concrete time not sweet ,comma trajectory saxby international economist said at the scene for his documents that whole loans great power has kept and must cooperate if top that it is not to be saying to d. c.'s written poverty stricken devastation no way is more important in these patients in china ,comma to one .point three billion people now being transformed into a double ,comma the norwest insurance and strength work china chooses to do and more importantly ,comma she chooses to do it will be crucial in the next phase of the world's development is beeson gregory ford of china's has already come to pass a price not to the east and the damage that's been done to attain byrom and it's still a one party state without democratic nations and many in the west indies at the qana half full ,comma well staged into the contest is matched to the individual vivid t. and human rights geeky method to his reputation in the people's republic of banishing rethinking and with its cannot ortiz tonight on many of its students as well as academics jennifer and businessman with whom to discuss the case is made to the test tube is welcome to his beefy recent track jiffy sacks pack asked to be in everybody's head what produce studied here kicking university and to be together for which you would end what a thrill a noose for me to have the chance of this unique lecture series to wreath lectures to have a part in a global discussion a discussion that we must have been the beginning years of our new century if we are to achieve what we hope to which he met his peace and prosperity shared around the planet aidid we all sense that we are at very important decision points in the planet's and with obvious risks than with huge opportunities and assume just said there is no place on the planet of more significance for these choices before it so it only segment as well as for the world say to that as china today the country bidding every single way your calls for superlatives units or roll its dimensions would end of the stakes for the world here we are in a famous and beautiful magnificent hall of the ten fouls and hit the masses as is called but if you think about it stood for china's fastest we would need to a hundred thirty's collison such halls of penthouse and people each to accommodate the one .point three billion people of this country to country so fast that of course ,comma it is one fifth of the world's population and quickly becoming a u. absolut in center of global economy as well as many of the challenges that will discuss tonight not only use it to the world's most populous country is one of the world's most crowded contras and it is certainly one of them mostly bar mentally spurs rest regions of the world i call my lecture that today's yet for the seat eight term deduce a una spectacularly vivid aid permitted invented by one of the great scientists of our age paul kreutz and to signify the fact that human indeed use for the first time had taken hold not only of an economy or our population and a very physical systems of the planet itself and from the scene of meeting human created etiquette are known for is earth's history be geologists call are high in the whole scene that's the period of the last thirteen thousand years or so since the last ice age recruits in why sweet and perhaps others shockingly noted that the last two hundred years are really a unique that it not only in human history but in the physical purchase history as well yet for dizziness that purity when human activities has overtaken vast parts of the natural cycles on the planet and has done so when ways that the range dole cycles and that fundamentally threaten asked indeed in the years ahead now considering how we're going to face the dual challenge of seed continued economic progress which we dearly hope for a kidney stone tree and a other parts of the developing world and continued economic well being of course and progress in today's already high heat ,comma world how winking combining back economical weedy profile indicating growing in farm apple dangers that we face is the subject of our reflections today what absolutely striking and paul's always need to solve is the basic facts are as follows while we are already doing on the planet in terms of the facts and physical systems is literally the unsustainable week could not go on doing what we're doing so we have already reached the point of liberal and sustainability is sensitive weekend team you're on our current path using resources the way we use them now that the scale we use them now we would be hit very harsh boundaries that would do great damage to human wellbeing to the physical or any two vast numbers literally millions of other species on the planet bought we haven't even harder problem to solve the now one and that is we don't want to stop your in terms of where we are urging consumption or economic activity to develop a hard freeze and worrying the most populous and call them but to develop a world which is five or six of humanity right leaky and understandably says they would like their place in the sun is well if the i. a. ,comma world as a chief aide ,comma levels of comfort levels are below the safety and life expectancy of a vast proportions will one about the rest of humanity and from my point of view is a development economist something absolutely water full is happening something that i think we could get it all at the age of convergence and that is the measure of economic development the methods the institutions to processes the agitation of advanced technologies is becoming a worldwide phenomenon now tragically not every part of the world as yet part of that phenomenon and i will have the chance to discuss that in a later lecture when we talk about the poorest of the four were still not part of this dynamism but wonderful loses that large parts of the planet are part of its dynamism china is of course do the very forefront most dramatically in an unprecedented manner catching up in technology economic activity human wellbeing and let's not golf the improvements of living not only don't know if conventional measured living standards but acumen wellbeing and white expectancy depreciated to get opportunities you chances to fulfill lights hopes that ,comma along with his economic improvement and the process is now are powerful through the powerful wheeze of globalization to market forces futility of ideas and technology to flow across national boundaries had been a precedent to great so we have the world economy now growing at approximately five percent proud of and that is a four percent to approximately of per capita aidid ,comma he increases the and one percent per year broccoli of the global population increased but that he is we are on course for a massive decreased of economic activity jost what's we would like to see getty still pour patrice of the world those who aspire to happy chances of that technology in science have brought us any is fair to say that given current trends we have a powerful forces of economic convergence in most parts of the world and get the processes of convergence continue operating as they had in recent decades one could expect that perhaps the average per person a calm on the planet could rise as much as four times between now and the century population of course no increasing more slowly in proportional terms than it did in the second half of the twentieth century is still increasing in absolute terms by an astounding amount of seventy two with eighty million people per year and on the median forecast of the un population division that leads to a projection of a rough week h. jones increase of another two when a half billion people on the planet by the year twenty fifty ross elite population increasing by close to fifty percent eat come on at half baruch disasters of various kinds to decrease proximate lee fourfold multiplying wanted a half times for suggests that the current economic trajectory would lead to a decrease of world economic activity of six times between now and twenty fifty now that's the bull from the point of view of economic development but think about the paradox it already we are in eight lead early and sustainable trajectory and yet china india large parts of asia are successfully barreling ahead now with unprecedented leave rapid economic development were asking some how our planet to absorb eighty many fold the increase of economic activity in top posts in already existing degree gunfire mental stress that we'd never before seen on the planet of course we'd actually courted not do this we would not be able to decrease sixfold in economic activity ,comma are current technologies before the fire metal catastrophes would literally choke off this economic growth starch and steam and water stressed before station owner or the various parts of the world species extinction would cause this projection could override even before we were able to do such grave damage on the planet but that does pose the fundamental question what will give the union now many people think the only thing that can give to the use the living standards and high income world and some council that they will have to be crushed where his father isn't believed that we are falling for the bitter struggle between the rich and the four in the years ahead i want to argue with that their use the only way for peacefully body is a viable way for an aggies eight changes of the wheat we would've that allows for continued improvement of living standards in all parts of the world that allows for the aspirations of catching up but doesn't also permit us to square the circle of environmental stress and economic development now what can we do does it mean that any economic growth does it needs to pay to go home so the developing world doesn't need die or cutbacks of living conditions and abbott ebullient today's rich world idle lead that there is another course and it's a course we must take their article east freeways that out of this conundrum first courses use why use fuel efficiency of energy efficiency so that we can get more economic output wheat last direct use of fossil fuels sat in a golf course is the substitution of not fossil fuels for the fossil fuel so that peru unit of energy the additions of carbon dioxide can be reduced whether it's nuclear power safely deployed for more economical solar power for windows or biomass there's definitely a role though perhaps not as dramatic as we might hope for a substitution of the non fossils he rolls for today's heavy dependence more than eighty percent of our commercial energy use there's a third alternative as well and that is to learn to use our existing fossil fuels safely and for trying out an eightieth this is perhaps the single most important call for peace countries and for the planet one idea on the drawing board which needs to get the two demonstration of production in this country as soon as possible and that means nearly immediately is the idea of power plants which burn coal to generate electricity capturing the carbon dockside that they would otherwise have made palm beach unit of pipelines and pumping it eighty to the euro because safe geologic reservoirs now that the question for the planet and unprecedented challenge to move to weigh sustainable energy system requiring eight degree of cooperation and foresight and planning any time dimension of decades kennelly do when it we find that that level of public understanding political consensus direction and determination we may take it with a nice beaches but declined it will change whether we stated or not there is no state aid this one this one gets depended not on what we actually do not what we say we do now very quickly i want to mention one whole pull analogy and bad news column we had successfully as a world avoided what seem to be another and was another desperate risk and now it was the depletion of the ozone layer it was discovered by paul fruits and you'd scientist who brought us the chance for the c. e. challenge of ozone as well he and two colleagues sure what role ended mario molina discovered accidentally as it were dated each capitals the we use for refrigeration and for our aerosols that floor floor carpets the c. f. c. east posed a grave risk to survive on the planet because of their accidental interactions in the stratosphere that quitting had destroyed the ozone layer yu was an accidental discovery of brilliant science it took song you're is for the public to be aware that when the scientists said that the neighbors of the c. s. c. said it best in science we fertile for their work adding to that i asked but any nasa in united states to snap the picture from one of its remarkable satellites show when a hole in the ozone layer in a way it needed to insure that saved the world was as soon as people saw that hole with taro or not is they weren't listening to the chairman of dupont anymore they were feeding about their survival in the survival of their children the public awareness sorted that pressure for action decreased at appoint dupont and other companies scientists went to work on a determined there was an alternative to the c. f. c.'s door all are safer ,comma schools that could be heard for jurists that could be a deodorant cast bigot beady aerosols not surprising after all they found them and a fourth stapp took place a whispered in the years of the politicians he so paid you could reach an international agreement we can handle this and quickly actually remarkably quickly from the basic science to the international agreements took about fifteen years and by nineteen ninety eight global framework was in place that called for the phasing out of the chlorofluorocarbons and its port is on a path of eddies of relative safety with regards to that risk with climate i believe we have the same hopes now a much more difficult issue eight problem dating gets to pick up more on the functioning of the world economy so one that cannot be solved from one day to the next requiring eight basic change of heart infrastructure are energy systems which will take decades to complete but process nonetheless that aidid is underway in the same way first a new science back in eighteen ninety six and that of modern science in the last twenty five years and as soon as the science kane came big companies would investigate for saint john's science because that's their instinct star bobby but you don't lobby against nature nature has its principles it doesn't matter what the boards of these companies say what matters is the actual physical mechanisms to science was right it becomes more and more known now why he bozo crisis public awareness has been a second stapp for along time climate change was discussed as something for the far future now woods understood assaulting imperiling asked today as well the heat wave in europe in two thousand three claiming more than twenty thousand lives for aid to treat out aids storm devastated proportion shopping the american people and the world about what climate can do more heat negative browsed in australasia baited took place this year and destroyed a substantial part of australia's export crop that massive typhoons being experienced by this country as well as the warming taking place in large parts of this country and severe droughts in the curator of china have all made climate change at immediate issue it understandable issue and one that of course will get worse than going to see is this scientists and engineers are now scurrying technological alternatives are being developed target capturing seek west ration is beginning to be put to induct lacy demonstration projects so to alternative knotted fossil fuel energy source says and sold to remarkable breakthroughs in energy efficiency such as hydrated and plugging hybrid automobiles would promise last of vastly more efficient automobiles so more of my wood should per kilometer or my dope driven it good news is that those technological breakthroughs are similarly leading big companies to whisper in the years of the politicians it so kate we can handle this and asked the best news of all the companies around the world are now when the lead of their politicians in fact they're telling the politicians we half act we while a framework we needed incentive mechanism we need a price structure so that we can move ahead we sustainable energy i always forget to get their we'd only global negotiations on a truly global framework exists elmer up this year in bali indonesia weaker greeted principle on a framework convention on climate change that we must stabilize greenhouse gases we took it up early small step in the so called kyoto protocol but is solely a fall of the very small set of commitments for a limited part of the world may only europe because the united states did not beat detroit now when december wheat mosque happy you west and china eightieth and the european union and other parts of the world all coming together and say we must do this for ourselves and for the future nature has spoken more loudly than vested interests this is not a matter of vested interests this is a matter of common interest the staff's from the science to the public awareness to the technological alternatives to the international agreements are the very steps that we will need even for all aspects of pianists are perceived this will leave a mark of our new hero science based global policy made the peacetime worldwide public awareness basket to be true for saving the rain forests for seating at aro haitians from overfishing for managing water stress and for choosing population alternatives that are sound for the planet and sound for the individuals as well we don't have to do would sap the population trends because people would choose fertility reduction voluntarily in large parts of the developing world that the alternatives are made available to them in their individual choices as well weekend do this and we will learn that the costs of action are tiny in fact compared to the risks of inaction climate change can be solved according to the best current estimates for less than one percent of world economic aid each year and perhaps well under that where the potential costs are a devastating multiple of several percent of world income if we continue on to business as usual trajectory are wanting an aged where i started the first lecture whitmire favored speech of president john kennedy he talked about the challenge of peace that he is our biggest challenge on the planet and peace is also threatened by environmental risk but he also told us he nets speech that we have chances he said it and i repeat because i think you use our common thread our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by a man and man can be a speed as he walks no problem human destiny is beyond human beings man's resented spirited often solve this seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do would again that is the spirit of the net for the c. i. q. for much packed fifty sacks thank you very much indeed time nineteen taking questions from a people hitting the ground of the ten thousand masses of the key new investing an icon to invite to the to protect christian festivals yu yang jie uses offends his tunnel link students yet peking university will have few christians who think he is back in questions about to what extent should it protect the garments as lindh is a complex be taking from until pretax and add to the economic development is alive and is a close but it has always stopped economic development for a steak house in amman to open talks in sanaa classed as astutely find all too apparent speak to the two banking the choice that sometimes puts economics versus the environment views largely misstated the date the part it is part of the economic well being it's knocking contrast economic well being not let the state that choices that we actually based on how to use land how the fish are how to use our energy resources are less dire and less painful than we think if we will closely and are real opportunities especially with technology i talked about the new kinds of sustainable energy systems that we can adopt at relatively low cost but let me talk about it other massive overfishing of the oceans we'd eat wood destruction of the fisheries china is the pioneer now had a global scale and alternative pops hope coulter so massive fish farming and china viewed farms that perhaps eighty to ninety percent of all the world's fish farming now that's a technology farming to fish rather than depleting the oceans begins is hopeful that it's not as my cresson is that pollack and you will make teran needs to understand is nice to millions and millions of people just see their hope to be calm reach or have that opportunity to change their mature alive appointees that the cost of this are not to say to the chinese people you will not be cheap economic development board to the american people for that matter purity ,comma levels will be deeply undermined know that's the point the point is if we mobilize our science and technology well if we prove that demonstrated the fumes carbon captured seats was rationed or other technologies will find that we can why usefully to zip course out of its if we simply are too afraid to look like full radically greedy already symbol mindedly shortsighted benny the dangers will mount weld welby yon acosta we would pay with clear action that's what needs to be explained many bringing james king syndication rights to his name too wet to the far east for the cost eighty five he is but a book about the rise of china and counting heads in the business operations in a case in the international media company james locust jeffrey muir of speech youth that painted a picture really to rethink picture of a global informant meltdown when you said that one of the keys in a resting its case public advocacy in other words giving people the voids so those people can keep governments in the big companies ,comma it's that as you well know china is known to be paid in giving people a voice is that soft a government at the central level as of a very keen understanding of the environmental issues but often at local levels governments that corrupt and that in bed with the big cruising companies so that what would you say it isn't remotely possible that china will have drew out enough pluralism enough public advocacy and enough democracy to solve the environmental problems that you are outlined it is not only remotely fair possible i think it's very likely in fact these gunfire mental challenges the power not feeding from fuel there felt to be in the daily lives of people living on the young seer the massive pollution that has been seen the heavy air pollution in the cities of china and doll or a whole world that is going to be a saint to china very soon perhaps o. within the next three or four years you'll cut people's republican are the number one in it are of carbon dioxide in the whole world so whatever you think you're affecting the whole world's climate what's committee interesting is that as china over takes united states is the largest maker you less says that a star complaining bitterly what are you going to our clients fully by dennis and set himself a fan as so what's going to happen is that the whole world is more and more will understand that this use daughter we are seeing the change with the just the last three or four years of public awareness not because a fury not because of lectures but because of what is being felt in daily lives i've had excellent discussions with the chinese leadership over the last year on these issues they are fully aware of this and i believe that this is going to be the realization he this concrete in a yet even in the united states of war or of finding a few new west politics at the change in the last you are that this remarkable katrina and the other force of nature vice president al gore has had his head at fawcett stefan sat out his team's one to get oscars for climate change you got to know the war on our way this thing went to his using is a sign that volunteering and beating the new hints he would sell its competitions i agree that the central governments in as a big hand in this they they realize the big problems but do what what i've seen in many other generous to go around the country seemed time and time again is that local governments do not obey the central government and they are corrupt and then all sinking about the planet that think about their own short term profits at item seat really many programs in africa penniless and the only subject to fight could stymie admitting that some people who they can and who would not speak on the city gets him enough ideas in a garden james at what he does ,comma similar in scope and a friend that these reports are from the c. t. v. one day they went to look completely gel because you know that my knees in the columns be allowed to shout out those small e. beagle minds get back to see his to the stress they essential commonsense to corral it about a second mother involvement because the whole conti is done ,comma is the pending in the minds if they close their isn't our economy further okonski bath of prominent singers when looking at me just bringing up the nile that questioning him on the front of the disease on this subject to confront a he's nine to boost that it said it had essentially by stations in china called the institute of public environment assessment of your question high i'm glad not to mention in today's ward of globalized issue we need more cooperation on the global m. barnett of governance we are running a national water pollution database on recently when we clapton is stoked water polluters and we came across a field in a sixty seven to multinational companies from japan from us from euro and they will call by the local agencies of violating the basic discharge standards and this freeze concern over a global transfer of pollution in today's what caught globalized and and manufacturing but some in the western countries argued that city bilko companies are polluting nan d'amato nationalist as should not be blamed for doing the same in this country and i want to hear your comments on at the fair at all of these is points are correct and also need to be understood in a dynamic process the city is no doubt the flight for new ways of doing things in this country and in the world many of the examples is that it had been given could have been examples that he made any of our countries market forces by themselves are often quite powerful long quite shortsighted because markets don't heed clued he sold troll the damages that go along with the suit polluting or resource depleting activities adequately and therefore we need to be collective action did countervailing stockmarket eye and not hurt when hit from one gate to the next we're going to have a change that is going to solve these problems he the guy said many times just on climate change issue this will actually take decades d'souza cresson and double standards disease across about rots the nationalist doing then said he would kill to easiest brazen in japan is bringing that toxic waste to let it sell confused as to what is now a guy to do well if the west is doing that tiara with two other cities that often seems to have cooperation from houston to link up with the west would she want to fight this guy i don't call it double standards it's just we have poor environmentalists reformists all over the world there's not a place in the world that is truly a fire that police to stay a total alcohol is the hope that his goal still because the whole world climate is being changed ought we are also in a process of tremendous global recognition and rise of understanding of this just in a short period of time aidid will predicts that by twenty ten we have big holes kyodo agreement reached one that has included all conferees china the united states' european union and others that the greek to targets that are serious about heading off this kind of environmental passed in two years' time china had us we're will agree to the doubts what i said i'll say it again isolated by what he had we will have a deep holes kyodo global agree on what needs to be "double-quote didn't you have what it had been hiding in the got -hyphen i don't know if i'm predicting it and i sat back for getting it on the basis of the party that haitians benign aid which is that these issues dole from the site and to the public awareness to the technological options to the agreements and i think we're getting that phase right now actually what's different about rind numb not await him by saying things are changing and actually putting it paid on it as well i believe that by twenty ten we will have an agreement by the league could be more specific that every major presidential candidate in the united states for its apple in the two thousand eight election will have a strong climate change point so will see daddy in real time whether a crime of right or merely dreman wrecking the reason i believe that this is happening is that the scientific consensus is sound because the major oil companies are actually running advertisements every day you the global press about the dangers of climate change now something has changed ,comma for the better and that's a good point in this if not in the brains and jonathan bullet sees the gaudy in correspondence hitting southeast asia ,comma "double-quote he didn't do ,comma i came back today from new fund which is the pasquale views being declared as the most poorly to cesium whole planet con it was particularly horrible but the message was contradictory villas on one side the local government said that they wouldn't play is down a hundred and sixty of a hundred blazing allying pliant foundries which says it has huge said it is more environment awareness here or the other side of most local people said we don't believe the government we don't trust the media that people is that you said we could get in trouble if we speak to another is that we don't want to seem barn in the week on changes we have no way of affecting government policy some requesting his fist bases still have one policy dictates a ship what you think is the role of all public accountability in improving the environment and if i could just be a devil that occurred in some ways would need the best of if we had to agreeing to take to ship to solve the world's problems rather than agreeing democracy were packing their public accountability is extremely important but the problem is in sight of these foundries he's not the problem of one political system it's a problem of low pulpit ,comma the baby's truly united states for trying out for that many other places where you have the local economy depending on the probably defunct technology at this point that his fields up the set of jobless in an environmentally unsustainable manner and that is a top challenger anywhere so one needs a set of instruments and institutions to provide you there alternatives to help retrofit factories to providing compensation for the fire metal wood jost meant and so forth in a lot of those institutions don't exist in this country because the challenges are awaiting faced right now for the first time that the p. c. could see was how important is democracy holds some and i think that democracy in china are obsolete and think them op i agree that most of what he said but i think you do kind of dollars to die ?question-mark a seventy four leaders of our businessmen coming to china not to his well once told about human rights and democracy is about other things on that right there on overloaded people during what can and are immensely season bench heroes do maybe they've winquist mope ciba think they would like more pools today would influence government policy and in the schools in the last world than a free media in goods and basic things we still don't have the time that suggests how important is to maintain democracy to china's development in you'll few i think that china will become more democratic overtime and i think that china will become as i say any centralized over time as well this is the beach for above the developments taking place and are already apparent in this country if one has any sense of change that's taking place this is already happening and it's happening to the goal it and i'd really don't believe for that outsiders ,comma a u. n. meeting civil claims so it really helps the process i do believe that china's politics are for the chinese people and i believe that these changes will come it will be china's interests they will be the world's interest but the way to the world should best handled this is to help china to which he did schools tend to find global ,comma points of the meeting and global challenges like climate like a global security because these are the ways that we can build trust build understanding and build a framework worked change keeps the place in a peaceful and useful way thank you very much in the tank utah's pack hatch has too few new ireland and had not
