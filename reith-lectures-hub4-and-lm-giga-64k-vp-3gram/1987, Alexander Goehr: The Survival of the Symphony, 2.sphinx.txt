port of china's has already come at a price not policing the damage that's been done to its indictment extend a one party state without democratic erections and many in the west indies had caught half

us to not audience tonight on many of its students as well as academics jennifer and businessmen who will discuss the case is linked to the test tube is welcome to seize bt seed recent track jeffe sacks pack asked who did it ever thought it had what it produce studied at peking university and to be together at which you would end what a thrill it is for me to have the chance of this unique lecture series to reap lectures to have a part in a global discussion of discussion that we must have been the beginning years of our new century if we are to which she is what we hope to which he met its peace and prosperity shared around the planet aidid we all sense that we are a very important decision points in the planet's and with obvious risks than with huge opportunities and assume just sat there is no place on the planet of more significance for these choices for its of owning segment as well as for the world say to that as china is today the country bidding every single way your calls for superlatives units or roll its dimensions saluted and of the states for the world here we are in a famous and beautiful magnificent hall of the big ten thousand of masses as is cold but if you think about it to a four china's fastest we would need to a hundred thirty thousand such halls of penthouse of people each to accommodate the one .point three billion people of this country to country so fast that of course ,comma it is one fifth of the world's population and quickly becoming a u. absolut is center of global economy as well as many of the challenges that will discuss tonight not only use it the world's most populous country is one of the world's most crowded on treason and that is certainly one of them mostly bar mentally spurs arrests regions of the world i call my lecture that today's yet for the seat eight term deduce a una spectacularly vivid aid permitted invented by one of the great scientists of our age paul kreutz and to signify the fact that human being is for the first time have taken hold not only of an economy for our population and a very physical systems of the planet itself and from the scene of meeting human created etiquette article for new or its history the geologists call our time the whole scene that's the period of the last thirteen thousand years or so since the last ice age recruits in why sweet and perhaps other shockingly noted that the last two hundred years of our relief that you need that they not only in human history but in the physical purchase history as well yet from the scene is the period when human activities has overtaken vast parts of the natural cycles on the planet and has done so when in ways that the range dole cycles and that fundamentally threaten asked indeed in the years ahead of considering how we're going to face the dual challenge of seed continued economic progress which we dearly hope for getting this concrete ended all or parts of the developing world and continued economic well being of course and progress in today's already friday ,comma world how we can combine that economical weedy profile indignity growing in farm apple dangers that we face is the subject of our reflections today's what's absolutely striking and paul's always need to solve is the basic facts are as follows while we are already doing on the planet in terms of the facts and physical systems is literally unsustainable week could not go on doing what we're doing so we have already reached the point of liberal and sustainability is sensitive weekend team you're on our current path using resources the way we use them now that the scale we use them now we would be a case very harsh boundaries that would do great damage to human wellbeing to the physical or any two vast numbers literally millions of other species on the planet bought we haven't even harder problem to solve the now one and that is we don't want to stop your in terms of where we are urging consumption or economic activity to develop a hard freeze and worrying the most populous and call them but the developing world which is five or six of humanity right to leave an understandably says they would like their place in the sun is well if the i. a. ,comma world as a chief income levels and comfort levels of attila the safety of life expectancy of a vast proportions will one about the rest of humanity and from my point of view as a development economist something absolutely water full is happening something that i think we could get it all at the age of convergence and that is the measure of economic development the methods the institutions that processes the agitation of advanced technologies is becoming a worldwide phenomenon now tragically not every part of the world as yet part of that phenomenon and i will have the chance to discuss that in a later lecture when we talk about the poorest of the four were still not part of this dynamism but wonderful loses that large parts of the planet are part of its dynamism china is of course do the very forefront most dramatically in it are oppressive into batter catching up in technology economic activity human wellbeing and less not golf the improvements of winning a battle you don't know it can then choi measured living standards but acumen wellbeing and white expectancy victory should get opportunities in chances to fulfill lights hopes that ,comma along with this economic improvement and the process is now are powerful through the powerful wheeze of globalization to market forces futility of ideas and technology to flow across national boundaries and a precedent to great so we have the world economy now growing at approximately five percent proud of and that is up four percent to approximately of per capita aidid ,comma decreases and one percent per year broccoli of the global population increased but that he is we are on course for a massive decreased of economic activity just what's we would like to see getty still poor countries of the world knows who aspired to happy chances of that technology in science have brought us and it is fair to say that given current trends we have a powerful forces of economic convergence in most parts of the world and gives the processes of convergence continue operating as they had to be in recent decades one could expect that perhaps the average per person a calm on the planet could rise as much as four times between now and the century population of course no increasing more slowly and proportional terms than it did in the second half of the twenty century is still increasing in absolute terms by an astounding amount of seventy two with eighty million people per year and in the medium forecasts of the un population division that leads to a projection of of roughly eight garuda the increase of another two when a half billion people on the planet by the year twenty fifty ross elite population increasing by eight close to fifty percent eat ,comma and a half bari disasters of various kinds to decrease proximate lee fourfold multiplying wanted a half times for suggested the current economic trajectory would lead to a decrease of world economic activity of six times between now and twenty fifty now that's the bull from the point to view of economic development but think about the paradox it already we are in eight lead early in unsustainable trajectory and yet china india large parts of asia are successfully barreling ahead now we have unprecedented leave rapid economic development were asking sol are planted to absorb a nanny for the increase of economic activity in top posts in already existing degree of gunfire mental stress that we'd never before seen on the planet of course we'd actually could not do this we would not be able to decrease sixfold in economic activity ,comma are current technologies for the environmental catastrophes would literally choke off this economic growth back arch ships steaming water stressed before station ,comma heard in various parts of the world species extinction would cause this projection to go over arrived even before we were able to do such grave damage on the planet but that does pose the fundamental question what will give the union now many people think the only thing that can give it is the living standards and high income world and some council that they will have to be crushed where his father is a bullied fit we are falling for the bitter struggle between the rich and the four p. in the years ahead i want to argue with that their use the only way for peacefully body heat is a viable way for an daddy's eight changes of the wheat we live that allows for continued improvement of living standards in all parts of the world that allows for the aspirations of catching up but doesn't also permit us to score in the circle of environmental stress and economic development now what can we do what does it mean that any economic growth does it needs to ended the hopes of the developing world doesn't need da or cutbacks of living conditions and abbott ebullient today's rich world title lead that there is another course and it's of course we must take there are at least three ways out of this conundrum first forest is why skew leticia seat energy efficiency so that we can get more economic output we last direct use of fossil fuels sacked a golf course is the substitution of not fossil fuels for the fossil fuel so that per unit of energy the additions of carbon dioxide can be reduced whether it's nuclear power safely deployed for or economical solar power for windows or biomass there's definitely a role filled perhaps not as dramatic as we might hope for a substitution of a non fossils he rules for today's heavy dependence more than eighty percent of our commercial energy use there's a third alternative as well and that is to learn to use our existing fossil fuels safely and for china and india this is perhaps the single most important call for peace countries and for the planet one idea on the drawing board which needs to get the two demonstration of production in this country as soon as possible and that means nearly immediately is the idea of power plants which burn coal to generate electricity capturing the carbon dockside that they would otherwise admit palm bigoted white clients and pumping it eighty to the euro because state geologic reservoirs now that the question for the planet and unprecedented challenge to move to weigh sustainable energy system requiring eight degree of cooperation and foresight and planning any time dimension of decades can we do when it we find that that level of public understanding political consensus direction and determination we may take it with an ice speeches but the climate will change whether we take it or not there is no state aid this one this one is depended not on what we actually do not what we say we do now very quickly i want to mention one whole paul analogy and bad news column we have successfully as a world avoided what seemed to be another and was another desperate risk and now was the depletion of the ozone layer it was discovered by paul fruits and you'd scientist who brought us the chance for the c. e. challenge of ozone as well he and two colleagues sure when brolin did mario molina discovered accidentally as it were dated each chemicals the we use for refrigeration and for our aerosols that floor for carpets the c. f. c. east posed a grave risk to survive on the planet because of their accidental interactions in the stratosphere that quoted had destroyed the ozone layer yu was an accidental discovery of brilliant science it took song you're is for the public to be aware that when the scientists said that the neighbors of the c. s. c. said it best in science we fertile for their work adding to that i asked but betty nasa in the united states to snap the picture from one of its remarkable satellites show when a hole in the ozone layer it away in a heated picture that saved the world was as soon as people saw that hole with their own i use they weren't listening to the chairman of dupont anymore they were feeding about their survival in the survival of their children to public awareness sorted the pressure for action decreased at appoint dupont and other companies scientists went to work on a determined there was an alternative to the c. f. c.'s door all are safer ,comma schools that could be heard for jurists that could be a deodorant cast baited beady aerosols not surprising after all they found them and a fourth stapp took place a whispered in the years of the politicians he so paid you could reach an international agreement we can handle this and quickly actually remarkably quickly from the basic science to the international agreements took about fifteen years and by nineteen ninety eight global framework was in place that called for the phasing out of the chlorofluorocarbons and has put us on a path of eddies of relative safety with regards to that risk with climate i believe we have the same hopes now a much more difficult issue eight problem dating gets to the core of the functioning of the world economy so one that cannot be solved from one aide to the next requiring eight basic changes of argue for structure in our energy systems which will take decades to complete but process nonetheless that aidid is under way in the same way first came the science back in eighteen ninety six and that of modern science in the last twenty five years and as soon as the science kane came to companies with a vested interest saint john's science because that's very state star lobbying but you don't lobby against nature nature has its principles it doesn't matter what the boards of these companies say what matters is the actual physical mechanisms to science was right it becomes more and more known now why he bozo crisis public awareness has been the second stapp for along time climate change was discussed as something for the far future now woods understood assaulting him kurland asked today as well the heat wave in europe in two thousand three claiming more than twenty thousand lives hurricane could treat out aids storm devastated proportion shopping the american people and the world about what climate can do the nagging droughts in australia that took place this year and destroyed a substantial part of australia's export crop that massive typhoons being experienced by this country as well as the warming taking place in a large part of this country and severe droughts in the curator of china have all made the climate change at immediate issue it understandable issue and one bit of courses will get worse that could use is the scientists and engineers are now scurrying technological alternatives are being developed carbon capturing seek west ration is beginning to be put to induct lacy demonstration projects so to alternative not fossil fuel energy source says and sold to remarkable breakthroughs in energy efficiency such as hybrid and plugging hybrid automobiles would promise last of vastly more efficient automobiles so more of my wood should per kilometer or my dope driven bid good news is that those technological breakthroughs are similarly leading the companies to whisper in the years of the politicians it so kate weekend handle this and ask the best news of all the companies around the world are now in the lead of their politicians in fact they're telling the politicians we half act we while a framework we needed incentive mechanism we need a price structure so that we can move ahead we sustainable energy idle lead for good to get their we'd all be global negotiations on a truly global framework in december of this year in bali indonesia weaker greeted principle on a framework convention on climate change that we must stabilize greenhouse gases we took it up early small step in the so called kyoto protocol but his only involve the very small set of commitments for a limited part of the world may lead europe because the united states did not beat detroit now when december wheat masa happy you west and china any yet and the european union and other parts of the world are all coming together and say we must do this for ourselves and for the future nature had spoken more loudly investigate truce this is not a matter of vested interests this is a matter of common interest the staff's from the science to the public awareness to the technological alternatives to the international agreements are the very steps that we will need even for all aspects of piano for a seat this will be a marker of our new hara science based global policy making peacetime worldwide public awareness basket to be true for saving the rain forests for seating and borrowed shoes from overfishing for managing water stress and for choosing population alternatives that are sound for the planet and sound for the individuals as well we don't happen to which sapped the population trends because people would choose fertility reduction voluntarily in large parts of the developing world that the alternatives are made available to them in their individual choices as well weekend to this end we will learn that the costs of action are tiny in fact compared to the risks of the inaction climate change can be solved according to the best current estimates for less than one percent of world economic each year and perhaps well under that were the potential costs are but devastating multiple of several percent of world income if we continue on to business as usual trajectory are one and a huge where i started the first lecture with my favorite speech of president john kennedy he talked about the challenge of peace that he is our biggest challenge on the planet and peace is also threatened by environmental risk but he also told us he met speech that we eat half chances he said it and i repeat because i think you use our common thread our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by a man and man can be as big as he walks no problem human destiny is beyond human beings man's resented spirited off insolvency italy unsolvable and we believe they can do would again that is the spirit of the net for the c. i. q. for much pack fifty sacks thank you very much indeed time nineteen taking questions from a people came in the grim as the ten thousand masses of the key new investing and i'd like to invite it to protect christian festival yu yang jie uses offend his economics students ghent peking university with a few christians who think you got that hit back by questions about to what extent should may protect the environment as lindh is a complex intake in rum until pretax and add to the economic development is alive and asean plus let's toast always stop economic development for a steak house in our mental protection slept last as astutely find gaultier aren't speaking to thank you the choice that sometimes puts economics versus the environment views largely misstated the date he parted as part of the economic well being it's knocking contrast economic well being not let the state that choices that we actually based on how to use land how the fish are how to use our energy resources are less dire and less painful than we think if we will closely at our real opportunities especially with technology i talked about the new kinds of sustainable energy systems that we can adopt at relatively low cost but let me talk about another massive overfishing of the oceans we'd eat wood destruction of the fisheries china is the pioneer now had a global scale opened alternative ops hope coulter so massive fish farming and china viewed farms that perhaps eighty to ninety percent of all the world's fish farming now that's a technology farming to fish rather than depleting the oceans begins its hope that it's not as my cresson is that holiday knew what made chang needs to understand is nice to millions and millions of people just see their hope to be calm retort average opportunity to change their mature alive the appointees that the cost of this are not to say to the chinese people you will not be cheap economic development board to the american people for that matter purity ,comma levels will be deeply undermined know that's the point the point is if we mobilize our science and technology well if we prove that demonstrated the fumes carbon captured seats was rationed or other technologies will find that we can why sleep to zip course out of its if we simply are too afraid to look like full radically greedy already use simple mindedly shortsighted benny the dangers will mount weld welby yon the cost of we would pay with clear action that's what needs to be explained many bringing james king is the biggest rice tends to do well to the far east for the cost ranges from timor's batista book about the rise of china and counted heads the business operations in the case in the international media company james locust jeffrey muir of speech youth of painted a picture really to rethink picture of a global environmentalists don't and you said that one of the keys in a resting its case public advocacy in other words giving people the voids so those people can keep governments in the big companies ,comma it's bad as you well know china is known to be getting giving people a voice is that soft a government at the central level as of a very keen understanding of the environmental issues but often at local levels governments are corrupt and that in bed with the big cruising companies so what would you say it isn't remotely possible that china will have drew out enough pluralism enough public advocacy and enough democracy to solve the environmental problems that you are outlined it is not only remote leaf or possible i think it's very likely in fact he's gunfire mental challenges saloon car not feeding from fuel there fell today in the daily lives of people living on the young seed beat massive pollution that has been seen the heady here pollution in the cities of china and doll or a whole world that is going to be a saint to china very soon perhaps o. within the next three or four years you'll and the people's republican are the number one in utter of carbon dioxide in the whole world so whenever you think you're affecting the whole world's climate with giddy interesting is that this title over takes the united states is the largest maker us is that a star complaining bitterly what are you going to our clients who will administer the set himself a fan as what's going to happen is that the whole world for more we all understand that this year's daughter we are seeing the change would be just the last three or four years of public awareness not because of theories not because of lectures but because of what is being felt in daily lives i've had excellent discussions with the chinese leadership over the last year ,comma these issues they are fully aware of this and i believe that this is going to be the realization he this concrete in a yet even in the united states of war or of finding a few new west politics at the change in the last you are fit his remarkable country not and the other force of nature vice president al gore has had his head have cars that can process about his team's one to get oscars for climate change you got to know the war on our way this thing or two is using it is a sign that volunteering and be seen the new heads to a selling its competitions i agree that the central governments in at the big and laments that they realized the big problems but do what what i've seen in many other generous to go around the country is seen time and time again is that local governments do not abate this interim government and they are corrupt and then all sinking about the planet with inky about their own short term profits in item seat really any progress in africa penniless and the only subject to strike could stymie admitting that some people who can't stand it and who would not speak on the city gets few we have ideas in a garden james that what he does ,comma similar in scope and a friend that these reports are from the c. t. b. one day they went to look completely gel because you know that my knees in the columns that moscow shocked outpost small e. beagle minds get back to see his to the stress they essential commonsense to corral it about the second month in altman's because the whole cobbs is done ,comma is the pending in the minds if they caused their isn't our economy for that conti bath of prominent singers whether plenty just bringing up the nile that questioning him on the other because it's on the subject of the primate he's nine to boost and it said it had essentially nine stations in china called the institute to public environment defense plant in ukraine high i'm glad not to mention in today's ward of globalized issue we need more cooperation on the global m. barnett of governance we are running a national water pollution database on recently when we clapton is stoked water polluters and we came across a field in a sixty seven to multinational companies from japan from us from euro and they will call by the local agencies of violating the basic discharge standards and this freeze concern over a global transfer of pollution in today's what caught globalize that amana factoring but some in the western countries argued that city billable companies are polluting nan d'amato nationalist as should not be blamed for doing the same in this country and i want to hear your comments on at the fair at all of these is points are correct and also need to be understood in a dynamic process deuce accusing no doubt the flight for new ways of doing things in this country and in the world many of the examples is that it had been given could have been examples that he knew any of our countries market forces by themselves are often quite powerful long quite shortsighted because markets don't heed clued he sold troll the damages that go along with pieces polluting or resource depleting activities adequately and therefore we need to be collective action that counter veils the market i am not arguing that for one gate to the next we're going to have a change that is going to solve these problems need the guy said many times just on climate change issue this will actually take decades to bases across about double standards disease across about rocks and ash knows denny mendez hulett killed easiest brazen uncertain is bringing that toxic waste to win a silver confucius elected not to add to the wealthy at the west is doing that tiara with two other cities that often seems to have cooperation from houston to lena with the west would she want to hire this guy i don't call it double standards it's just we have poor environmental performance all over the world there's not a place in the world that is truly environmentally cyst a total alcohol is the hope that his goal still because the whole world climate is being changed what we are also in a process of tremendous global recognition and rise of understanding of this just in a short period of time aidid will predicts that by twenty ten we have the polls kyodo agreement reached one that has included all conferees china the united states' european union and others that the greek to targets that are serious about heading off this kind of environmental passed in two years' time china hand us the war to meet tuesday and asked what i said i'll say it again i fully fit by what he had we will have a post kyodo global agreed and what needs you to that he "double-quote didn't you have what it had been in hiding in the got -hyphen i don't know if i'm predicting it and i sat back for getting it on the basis of the party that haitians benign aid which is that these issues go from the site and to the public awareness to the technological options to the agreements and i think we're kidnap phase right now actually what's different about ron numb not only by saying things are changing and actually putting it paid homage as well i believe that by twenty ten we will have an agreement i believe good to be more specific that every major presidential candidate in the united states for its apple in the two thousand eight election will have a strong climate change plant so it will see that in real time whether a crime of right or merely dreman wrecking the reason i believe that this is happening is that the scientific consensus is sound because the major oil companies are actually running advertisements every day in the global press about the dangers of climate change now solving has changed ,comma for the better and that's a good point in this it's not anything he and jonathan bullet tuesday guardian correspondent hitting southeast asia ,comma nucor things here ,comma i came back today from new fund which is the last five years being declared as the most polluted city of hope from a conde it was particularly horrible but the message was contradictory villas on one side the local government said that they would go into closed down a hundred and sixty of a hundred and eighteen allying pliant founders which says it has huge said there is more environment awareness here on the other side of most local people said we don't believe the government we don't trust the media that people is that you said we could get in trouble if we speak to another said we don't want this and are mentally current changes we have no way of affecting government policy summit question is this peace is still the one policy dictates a ship what you think is the role rudolph public accountability in improving the environment and if i could just get devils after could in some ways when they do best in the free -hyphen agreeing to take to ship to solve the world's problems rather than agree to democracy will fight the good public accountability is extremely important but the problem is in sight of these foundries he's not the problem of one political system it's a problem of low poll put it ,comma the baby's truly united states for trying out for that many other places where you have the local economy depending on the probably defunct technology at this point that is built up the set of jobless in an environmentally unsustainable manner and that is a top challenger anywhere so one needs a set of instruments and institutions to provide either alternatives to wealth retrofit factories to providing compensation for the fire metal wood jost meant and so forth in a lot of those institutions don't exist in this country because the challenges are awaiting faced right now for the first time that the p. c. could see was how important is democracy or something and then to democracy in china are obsolete and think them op i agree that most of what he said but i think you do kind of coats of that ?question-mark a seventy four leaders of our businessmen coming to china not to his will once told about human rights and democracy to have a lot of things go that way there are no four other people during whacking him are immensely season bench heroes do maybe they would quit demote ciba think they would like malts pools today would influence government policy and in the schools in the last world than the free media in votes from base things we still don't have the time that suggests how important is making democracy to china's development in your view i think that china will become more democratic overtime and i think that china will become as i say any centralized over time as well this is the date for both the developments taking place and are already apparent in this country if one has any sense of change that's taking place this is already happening and it's happening to the groin and i'd really don't believe for that outsiders ,comma a u. n. meeting civil claims so it really helps the process i do believe that china's politics are for the chinese people and i believe that these changes will come it will be china's interests they will be the world's interest but the way to the world should best handled this is to help china it would cheapen schools tend to find global ,comma points of the meeting and global challenges like climate like a global security because these are the ways that we can build trust build understanding and build a framework worked change can take place in a peaceful and useful way thank you very much in the tank and scott pack hatch has been too few hot olympians and offering support to artists he had to be king you will see next week we get through the j. p. sex to get on a unit of the new york way he
