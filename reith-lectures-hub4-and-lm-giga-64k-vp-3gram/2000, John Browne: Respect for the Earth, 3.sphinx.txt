has been at the very college of the debate on progress all strolled this country has produced a stream of people including join wreaths who refused to accept the world is life and its ad instead apply that knowledge and intelligence to create something desktop it is this sense of progress which is the topic under discussion indies week's elections is genuine progress still possible is development sustainable or is one strand of progress industrialization not doing such damage to the environment of the next generation when havel weld with living in consent of a future sustainability isn't a new buzz awaiting some state which appeared to threaten its fear is for exalt hold that the world would run out to woods cold boiled wool foot tall latins handled such times that last pass now people who responded to constructively and optimistic due to such challenges while others were fatalistic willing to accept declined rather than to tell him and to revise its soho we'd just then read ronning history and moments which in retrospect was seen to future generations may different from those of the cost i'd like to be aired what to say yes to the all stock -hyphen trading is not to know that cost the challenges are now more numerous and more complex neruda because the necessary also has caught the reduced to a single break through fifty years together but trinh russell port costing the first reflex shot to center to a nation that accepted the potential and the need for economic growth that today the potential for great itself is in question there is a fundamental consigned about the

faster pace in which to live while what is created to this pessimism that seems more malt intimate when i travel worldwide that the two listed impact as key factors such as the pressure is on population growth the pressures of the oven isolation water shortages in fall or mental challenges the quality of the air we breathe the pollution ovations the loss of species as habitats and transforms the gathering evidence of a fundamental change of the climate calls by human activity sustainability is about the environment and bios of asked the but are also factors as well the pressures created by weld in which global markets operate for twenty four rosin de seven days a week and by the removal of the compass and protection of the old ways of working age is as if history were constantly fixed salaries to wherein a weld without seles into a except for the certainty of change of weld well national cop shows and the credibility of institutions of democracy and challenge by political competitive pressures of the uncertainty infected as a mock described is also fueled by talks about sons' itself some of its uses such as the genetic modification of crops produced huge public skepticism and even jia again wanted us opinion continues to believe that progress is directing a sixty eight to with huge farms of technology in europe to votes of people are skeptical of that length so what can the businessmen say or do in response to these challenges facts i'm expected to make the speech of the accused standing in the talks that spinoffs how i see it ought to leave business is constructively engaged in resulting these problems and i believe the changes in technology and in the way the global economy works are giving the means to deliver it to human progress if i had to trade from the talk that would be the essence of my case and the dissolution of the five registration business is no single position to it as a fundamental role looking to differing sustainable development to meet the needs of today's world without depriving future generations of steadiness to doucette said that's a strong pass rush at this solemn countering should take so i realize it has to be justified by something old than an assurance of good intentions in hanson's bits about enlightened self interest this simple fact is the business needs sustainable society is in order to protect its karun sustainability will look and sound sox summarized in the shoes cost to ally status because very few businesses partial child activist is most want to do business again and again over many dictates and this is especially true if the businesses which honest often criticized those like mine which are in the business of extracting and developing the blows natural resources we all fight definition sweat away like this one off botelho trellis we have to do with the consequences of what we do for decades we called pak cop in government when the garay gets tough but in order to sustain what we had to we had to be preparing to change and the sort of change which business from acts is the abdication of technicolor tosses to meet human needs historically for the shares of shorter drive mentioned are the beginning of food to the force up lab and wood disapproved by change by technical breakthroughs which substituted one staying four not out and threw a fundamental shift in productivity which moved about on or is of a possible not to an unprecedented extent technology has the ability to repeat that process embracing of radical and transforming change beyond pool previous experience in other words norther redrawn of history but something very different we faced a revolution in the way the economy works doesn't buy new technology revolution which i believe would have major beneficial consequences for the good of our lumps and indeed folk or the issues under discussion in these weeks actress i think of it as a connected economy that connected in ways the net and then go for connected is not just from one house in port company to a knockout from bollenbach will one sellout but connected to this the brain is connected us and network of multiple and similar to the nearest linkages to connected economy is beginning to give us the ability to create new marketplaces and to integrate to manage complex systems at a distance in which a great position and speech that schools to give the house the ability to spread in chateau lynch instantly a what is left school to do with the environmental challenges with racing fest the shift in productivity is dramatically changing the way you wish frizzell says spot being used one of the first projects i was involved in this the young graduates was the development of the forties field in the north sea to the two

communications we can now stay in the drill bits in real time with intimations leading back to a computer screen only short apogee in as the drilling objectors to the rocks all troll box and this is the second point the connected economy isn't just about productivity it's also about letting in the way in which no ancient best practice can be developed disseminated and applied on a global basis to

place and seized the opportunity if and when it becomes available in this connected economy company isn't government space needs to hold up their responsibilities to relationship i've talked about it should give society into confidence to trust business to deliver sustainable development on the basis of enlightened self interest but of course this means that companies must play their full role if woolworth citizens to last in this critic's list also progressive initiatives stockman shuns such as reducing emissions shouldn't be happening because they cost money and but often that the media to
