politician you might have been added to clinton's in fact at the age of trained team on sometime in june on whether it that we can take to get you a present after the impeachment of richard nixon the notion that there is a chance to calm you instead of her positions are too young to well i was very interested in politics and political journalism and i was able by fear lock to get an internship that summer in the washington bureau of the houston chronicle are not from houston hadn't been nice to have never been accused by to his washington and a summer of nineteen seventy four when the supreme court was hearing arguments over the nixon tapes and whether he would have to give them over and when the house judiciary committee was deliberating about the impeachment of richard nixon in the sun cream come true and deans and you live in half from thirty five is again next month when the french was taken to keep us in peace distant drama set in the same weekend it is the room i remember powerfully was highest in a truck that vote it wasn't quite the way of west later when a impeach bill clinton when it was a partisan edge to it there was a sense of constitutional moment and feed the members as they call the roll their voices could embolden the state gave their votes in both sets and it's difficult to understand and we knew experienced the thrill of being accident at the heart of the story that was milking the world that she didn't carry on to become legends of was tempted back at the end of the summer and i was hoping that impeachment would take its course in the senate but i soon had to go back to college to term is about to begin so i began hoping for the resignation which was the only way i would see it to completion and richard nixon obliged him to the resigned just before i had to go back to college at the end of the summer i was talking with my boss to bureau chief about what an experience this again and he said used amana supposing his bleak fifties he said that he was sinking of retiring because there would never be a story like this again so i asked him what you're thinking of retiring because it will never be this good again what m. i. n. a h. twenty one supposed to think i did when deploying into political journalism but it was a fantastic sum it and you didn't line up becoming a politician friday became a dicicco philosopher lob which east shake to people who said he took the easy emulsion that gets easy to beat high nineteen games to the bidding tactics i seem to get in elective politics being a politician is an extremely demanding dropped and it is so far wall of the shenanigans ending misdeeds of politicians i do think that they're engaged in what potentially using noble exercise indeed do most of them a great great sacrifices to engage in food no fancy five is to get you a comparable to that of people with hearing loss this season and since then about politics and people michael florists hills pack his bank is still very much it's a great pleasure to be here for this poor reflex or other decor sunday's electricity i'd been arguing that we need to retrain him determines if political argument into waves first we need a public debate about tomorrow limits of markets and second we need a more robust public discourse one adding cage's more directly with morrow and even spiritual questions in this lecture and try to connect the seems and show how they can form the starting point for new politics of the common good first markets for three decades the governing philosophy of benighted states and britain was defined by defaced debt markets are the primary instrument for achieving the public could dip financial crisis has put his faith in question the bureau of market crying and solicit has come to an end to the wheat had yet to find a way to a new governing philosophy even president bill ,comma is yet to articulate what one epcot stucco to renew public philosophy is that persisting assumption from deja market trade it's what i'd like to call market mimicking governments it to the idea that the primary purpose of government is to correct what economists call market failure if it's the idea that government should try to replicate the outcomes that competitive markets would produce if of all goods and resources were properly priced considered environmental policy if their underwater are freeing addison priced ten companies in consumer is will produce too much pollution so government's job is to set regulations to correct for this market failure to cap and trade for example where a carbon tax to do a guest to policymakers have to ask how much pollution is too much and to answer this question they have to figure out what value to place on clean air clean water and the resulting health benefits here is where market mimicking governance comes into play and in order to make these calculations regulators often use cost benefit analysis that claes a monetary value on the benefits of cleaner air and water compared amid the costs and set regulations according to a good sound scripted play sensible what's wrong with comparing the costs and benefits of government regulation nothing if by comparing costs and benefits you simply need assessing the advantages and disadvantages of a given policy that cost benefit analysis aspires to scientific rigor that tries to assign a monetary value to costs and benefits if it tries to mimic the market and here's where it goes wrong many of the benefits of public policy in tall values that can't be captured in monetary terms most notably the deluge human life and we are for two examples the first involves smoking in the czech republican many people smoke philip morris that tobacco company sells a lot of cigarettes there seven years ago the czech government considered raising taxes on cigarettes philip morris wasn't happy about this so the company commissioned a cost benefit analysis of the effects of smoking and the czech national budget for the study found that the government actually makes more money than it loses from smoking all excluded smokers impose higher medical costs in the budget while they are a lot of dave died early and so save the government considerable sums in pensions has a penthouse care for the elderly according to the starting the so called positive effects of smoking one stake in into account cleave to when that game next to the czech treasury about hundred in forty seven million dollars per year so long cancer it turns out has its fiscal advantages now you might say that the cost benefit analysis kallis syllabus was simply incomplete it failed to calculate the cost to the smokers and their pearly and painful to modest but how might such costs be calculated a few years ago us in time mental protection agency tried to do this in presenting a cost benefit analysis of new air pollution standards he can see a sign of the monetary value to human life three .point seven million dollars per life saved except for people over the age of seventy whose lives were valued at two .point three million dollars ride high in the different valuations listened market mimicking assumption younger people whitmore years still to live would presumably pay more to save their lives than older people would hate to say there is advocates for the elder lee didn't see it that way they bitterly protested the senior citizen discount the difficulty of placing a monetary value on human life and other non market cards is one problem with cost benefit analysis and other is that monitor icing call costs and benefits makes for a spurious science that chefs decision making from democratic politics to technocrats considers cell phones should it be a legal to talk on the phone while driving up here years ago the harvard center for risk analysis at a cost benefit analysis to find out it concluded that crashes caused by cellphone use while driving cost about forty three billion dollars per year in medical costs and loss of life a sizable sum up the stodgy found by a strange coincidence that the economic benefits of cellphone use while driving also mounted to forty three billion dollars making it a breakeven proposition that if you let it get sanctions behind the numbers you find that they are hardly scientific the study assumes that cell phones cause twenty six hundred deaths per year but it admits that the actual number of such thefts per year is somewhere between eight hundred and eight thousand said depending on which member you choose the benefits of a ban on self and fog driving inside their nine million dollar risk or one hundred ninety three million dollars per year or maybe somewhere in between so there's this nothing scientific to the conclusion that the costs and benefits of cell phone use while driving are equal the mark had mimicking calculus is no better than hunch and even better example of the spurious science of cost benefit analysis is one offered by richard posner of prominent us legal scholar in judge and a founder of the law and economics movement posner analyzed the costs and benefits of a powerful particle accelerator built at brookhaven long island a federal research facility he wedded awaited benefits of the research against the very slight but rather alarming rest that the particle accelerator would destroy the earth posner estimated the value of the research to be two hundred and fifteen million dollars per year and the rest of the thing would destroy the earth to the one in ten million to decide whether it was worth as he signed a monetary value to dip potential extinction of the human race six hundred trillion dollars this doing the math he calculated that the cost of the project while wheat didn't affect by a hundred million dollars and so we conclude that it shouldn't be dealt cost benefit analysis is one instance when i'm calling market mimicking governance its objectionable on two grounds first it has a price tag on goods including human rights whose value can be captured in monetary terms second by claiming to be a science of public choice it elevates technocratic decision making at the expense of democratic deliberation but cost benefit analysis is only one expression upmarket mimicking governance another is a broader idea that the primary purpose of government is to correct for market failure economists have long recognized that markets don't produce sufficient outcome is uncertain circumstances when economic activity produces dexter analogies effects on third parties such as pollution or when it would be the impossible for a private company to collect payment from everyone who uses the service is a classic market failures that require government intervention that the idea that correcting for market failure is the main rationale for government that idea has emerged only recently it was the way tech center left parties in the defensive after the reagan captured near a cry to restate the case for government for a time it seemed to succeed whitney later in the new case in which bill clinton and the new democrats in united states as a governing philosophy however the task of correcting market failures is too humble and to narrow democratic governance is radically devalued it produced to the role of handmade in to the market economy in mock chrissy is about more than fixing and tweaking and dodging incentives to make markets work better the purpose of markets is to organize productive activities so as to maximize consumer welfare to democratic governance is about much more than maximizing g. d. p. or satisfying consumer preferences it's also about seeking distributed justice promoting the health of democratic institutions and cultivating the solidarity and sense of community that democracy requires market mimicking governance had its best can satisfy assets consumers but it can do nothing to make us democratic citizens why that have weak drifted on both sides of the atlantic away from older traditions of solidarity and civic virtue and toward more market oriented away said conceiving public life he'd answer does not lie simply in the market fundamentalism of the reagan tax for years or in the heady economic times in the nineteen nineties and use it for the crash market mimicking government's peace appeal in because it seems to offer a way of making political choices without making hard and controversy over moral choices it seems to be not judgmental so for example rather than engage in a morally charged debate about the proper way of valuing being financed or about the attitudes toward nature we should try to cultivate rather than due this week tried to set environmental policy by breaching from people's market preferences so we asked people how much they would pay to save the spotted owl we tried to determine the monetary value people implicitly placed on the allies when they accept risky jobs and then we cranked a dollar value human life or of spotted owls into its cost benefit analysis can we do the math specially we don't do the math experts and technocrats do it for us to not judgmental in false is also an entire democratic impulse this brings me back to its name that is run through these lectures he attempt to end the politics of morrow controversy may seem to be a way out of respect in our differences but it is a actually corrosive of democratic life the flight from moral judgment and moral argument in politics predates the euro upmarket triumph over some it found expression in both sides of the atlantic beginning in the nineteen fifties and sixties partly as a reaction against fascist and communist ideology is entirely as an attempt to spare politics from becoming embroiled in religious strife and it also reflected a growing faced in economics is evaluate neutral science held mcmillan expressed this sensibility when he said in nineteen sixty three quoted if people want a sense of purpose they should get it from their archbishop beach should certainly not get it from their politicians and quote in john f. kennedy have very different kind of politician articulated a similar sentiment most of the problem is that we now face kennedy said in nineteen sixty two are technical problems are administrators problems they are very sophisticated judgments which do not lend themselves to degrade sordid passionate movements which should strip this country so often in the past and quote kennedy was referring to the economy not to the civil rights movement but passionate movement if ever there was one and a powerful example of the marley contentious and spiritual inspired form of politics to renunciation of morrow and religious argument in politics in the decades following world war two for pared away for the market triumph alyssa of the past three decades but times have changed the financial crisis has discredited market tramps who listened in both its laissez faire or an neoliberal variants any election of our rocco bomb opt has given powerful expression to the hunger for a public life of larger meaning that engages more directly with morrow and spiritual questions all of which suggests that the time it may be right for a new kind of politics and politics of the common good what might touch of politics look like in light of market driven politics of politics at the common good invites festive think of ourselves less as consumers and more as citizens is why this matters market mimicking governance takes people's preferences as give and then sets them when we deliberated citizens when we engage in democratic argument the whole point of the activities is critically to reflect on our preferences to question them to challenge them to enlarge the to prove to every successful movement of social or political reform has done more than change the law it is also changed attitudes and dispositions wet tocqueville called the habits of the heart political leaders should bear this in mind when making the case for change consider health britain was able to create a taxpayer financed national health system because of a widely shared sense of social solidarity did said access to health care should not depend on a person's ability to pay united states has not yet been able to summon that solidarity if president know ,comma succeeds in getting universal health care you will not only be because people concluded that the present system is too costly and inefficient it will happen if and when americans are persuaded that providing for the health of everyone is among the mutual responsibilities of citizenship considered the indictment that the countries of the world are to pull to change patterns of energy use and bring about a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions it will not be because emissions trading schemes allow countries to buy and sell the right to pollute market mechanisms can be useful instruments that real change will depend on changing people's attitudes toward nature and rethinking our responsibilities toward the planet we share this is a moral and spiritual project not only an economic one final eight considering issue that doesn't get much attention and our politics these days inequality in united states as in most countries the gap between rich and poor deepened during the decades of market tramps alyssa inequalities of the commonwealth and now levels not seen since the nineteen thirties politicians find it difficult to talk about inequality even brock wrote lama's modest proposal to return to the income tax rates to where they stood in the nineteen nineties prompted charges during a campaign that he was a dangerous socialist who wanted to spread the wealth part of the problem i think is that we tend to talk about inequality isn't a problem we're harder redistribute access to private consumption but the real problem with inequality lice and the damage it does to the civic project to the common good here is why too great a gap between rich and poor undermines the solidarity that democratic citizenship requires this inequality deepens rich and poor living korea seemingly separate lives the affluent sanded children to private schools or to public schools as the column and united states in wealthy suburbs leading heard in public schools to the children of families who have no alternative to similar trend leads to the withdrawal by the privileged from other public institutions and facilities private health club is replaced municipal recreation centers and swimming pools affluent residential communities hire private security guards and rely less on public police protection as second or third car removes the need to rely on public transportation and sought this strenuous to banish acts one fiscal the other said it first public services deteriorated as those who no longer use them become less willing to support them with their taxes second public institutions such as schools parks playgrounds and community centers ceased to be places where citizens from different walks of life encounter one another institution is that once gathered people together and served as informal schools of civic virtue had put compuware gunfire between the hollowing out of the public realm makes it difficult to cultivate a sense of community that democratic citizenship acquires so rather than focus on access to private consumption of politics at the common good would make the case toward rebuilding the infrastructure of civic life public schools to which the rich and poor alike would want to send their children public transportation systems reliable enough to attract commuters from all walks of life public health clinics playgrounds parks recreation centers libraries in these scenes that would ideally at least drop people out of their gated communities in into the common spaces of a shared democratic citizenship in the course of these lectures at argued for a greater role for moral argument in public life and to the need to keep markets in their place at it like to conclude by anticipating one possible objections to distinguished economist kenneth herro once wrote an act quote like many economists i do not want to rely too heavily on substituting an ethics course self interest i think it is best on the whole that the requirement of ethical nikkei's here be confined to those circumstances when the price system breaks down we do not wish he said to use up recklessly the scarce resources of altruism u. motivation and quote the notion that ethics altruism and fellow fueling our scarce resources who supply is tech's once and for all and pleaded with fewest this idea seems to me outlandish outlandish but deeply influential mine a mideast lectures has been to call this idea into question i've tried to suggest to the virtues of democratic life community solidarity crossed civic friendship is virtues are not like commodities that are depleted which use their rather like muscles to develop and grow stronger with exercise the politics of morrow and civic renewal depends it seems to me in a more strenuous exercise of these civic virtues thank you very much pack haq has sent a thank you that much and he turned on him to bite and questions to the board will stay at george washington unionist out when to begin with the students can access the george washington university is named brendan hirings and chased him and a civic copycat groups you say we have a choice between being consumers and citizens and are now is the time for us to be citizens because free market consumerism in your view is filled republicans believe this is a false choice we are always citizens because you believe in american water represents a free market capitalism the free exchange of ideas and the freedom to choose your own destiny why it is the only solution lies in the hands of government intervention and the invention of a state where more and more of its citizens reliant government well i'm tempted to put a question back to abandon them i love to do that you can get them to do you think brandon of the freedom of the citizen is realized in market croatians when you think that require is a stronger civic engagement at the way that the trust between the consumer and a citizen is upholstered assessment of both yet to be a citizen but you're also a consumer and you have that right to choose your own destiny as an entrepreneur or whatever you choose to be in our system and that's what is different about every other country in the face the plan in my opinion is that you can come here with nothing and you have the freedom to choose your own destiny and to go out and pursue your dreams i think actually pursuing one streams that is the larger freedom for merely consumers store market freedom are not sure i would agree that only in the united states are people free to pursue their dreams but i would i would say that that way in describing your ideal of freedom does begin to take us to a larger moral vision that may be not be identical to the one that i've been proposing but it does take one important step away from the idea that all freedom consists in is the right to be a consumer in the marketplace identical may not attain the holland and if i made to stump up they he speed yet the us as it set the dates had a golf yet he's got hooligan he carried his palm to the desire for a new kind of politics and so akio societies are hearing the us but also the same widespread dissatisfaction with politicians how'd he changed the politics without changing the politicians that he talked about how to change politicians i think that you have to try to change both so you need to reform to clean up the kind of corruption that your newspaper exposed in britain but that's not sufficient idle think it's a clean up a system of expensive that would not begin not to answer the public is tired for a kind of political argument and debate it really addresses the things they care about most important of which is why you want hess also to attend to what i care called the terms of political discourse that shape of the political agenda the way we argue about politics i can see each eighty on he's supposed to washington as janice statistical connotation wages twenty comeback by going to the party election were huge spoke about the role of expertise and rent while it's easy to make fun of cars benefited now says that involves the destruction of the entire planet it like you to talk about we air is expert sees li jian admits we used to the democratic society and was a roll of experts to inform this democratic choice i think that insofar as acts spurts exert influence and authority dapper responsibility in public institutions should encourage that the experts themselves be participants in public deliberation about those questions so that they're not just people in a backroom cranking out cost benefit analysis calculations about the d. x. first themselves may day scientists are economists who whomever they may be joining in a public debate argument and then i don't answer questions but address challenges that may be put to them by their fellow citizens and in the fund and in accordance direct after i directed research at denny's gish knuckled heritage foundation by reaction to a lecture was why grief a much with their emphasis on solidarity on the way we think about politics i seek you set up but somewhat of a straw man in suggesting that it sold ice in the last bull markets or the week on sale in europe where markets in some way have pushed aside these all that important ways of looking at politics markets icing come into the picture more as a tool as a fast in how we think about these things when we go to some like education markets into the picture is an argument that in fact the public institutions he has let down the very people they were supposed to serve in the week in the usefulness of markets of choice of empowerment we financial power to be stopped these institutions to floss and to do the jolt that davis opposed to it not been doing a cake michael ,comma somehow it is certainly agree that markets can be effective mechanisms to challenge its for democratic politics is to keep markets in their place where we may disagree is indeed estimation of the extent to which markets have reached beyond their proper role over the last few decades in the war in iraq to take one very conspicuous example by two thousand and seven there were more private military contractors in iraq then there were us military troops now that may or may not be a good thing my point is we never had to debate about whether we want it to outsource for to private aid military contractors are not in that it happened and that its fateful for the condition of a democracy we never had that to date and anything involving school looks she see a deal that chief of a. b. c. news hit washington a cupid has to send nelson's in eighteen sixty south american public discourse is often quite divisive particularly over issues like abortion seems to marriage evolution versus creationism which has led us to this year when the story you're against us political mentality and i am curious paoli you seek we can move beyond some of those divides towards a more civil discourse and you think we need to in this country i do think we need to it and i think the way to do it is actually to be more willing to in gate to listen and even to argue about the competing moral and religious convictions that citizens bring to public life when he's made of dog and norris didn't hit george washington unit that sting nine questioning its seething cutbacks this attitude is politics as a comment that can really be back in style to win this economic crisis and mike didn't indicate governance because merely innovation ,comma is not in times of necessity bank in times of peace when ayodhya basic needs artifacts aren't really that crested a match i agree with the last act because sometimes :colon nicole innovation and change can come about during times of great pressing necessity pink nose f. d. r. in the new deal for example i guessing there does seem to be a lack of fayette released attention betraying the promise of moral and civic renewal that some of the country during the job ,comma campaign and dealing with the financial crisis essentially buy it trying to get enticements and subsidies to move the same investment bankers who had gotten us into this mess sought i do think that you are right to point to dish weighing rich beer at treasury and the administration went about trying to use the private markets to solve the credit crisis which may or may not work with his back to what politics and we have by c. n. o. o. d. and sitcom treatment he had also been put itself prize winning janis pacific mint gilchrist since he was in many ways still a bill clinton tony blair third way mueller for mama was ,comma thatcherism reagan is liked and by the previous question or one might wonder whether his robot are really is following that path do things you really isn't the crimson blared mold ultimately if he isn't what would be to sign what would his approach to this financial crisis look like from your point is you if you were indeed a radical departure that share is out of time what the of the political identity of steel bomb a presidency will ultimately be and to the handling of the financial crisis does give a reason for his hesitation and even i would say some concern so what would another protest look like well some people say the nationalizing the bank's in the public interest would've been a better more frontal and ultimately and stempler cleaner way of doing it ever had one advantage which would be to make explicit tasked the purpose here is the public purpose and it however we resolve the financial crisis we should do so in a way that minimizes the unfair advantage to be enjoyed by bankers and investors cruise conducted their companies got us into this mess in the first place and nationalizing would at least send that message in a way that a complex public private partnership involving yet more leverage doesn't compete in which you be ready to do that even if just to be brought to the experts told deputy matt grizzle would be a poor society with less rustic whether i would trust those experts would partly depend on whether they too might not have been implicated in the deregulation that led to this ,comma the identical and had to get some i wonder if michael is what makes you think that market trial culling some east delaying or has passed some kind of inflection point i wonder if we really are seeing a change i think we're at a point where it could go either way and the white lessons we learned from this experience will go a long way toward shaping the political possibilities including the possibility for a politics of that ,comma guard so hope michael e. took just three she had had on about within this lust the wright amendment with the commitment was like to change and maybe do you feel of that when people are uncomfortable that when the systems on which they have to pay me to settle seventy collapse and the need for east asia and idea that's found its man and will have to see if i don't think that the financial crisis by itself is the primary source of hope for a more marlene gauge public life so much of political leadership on this level is in the doing in nineteen thirty two when he ran for president franklin roosevelt did not run in the platform of the new deal his platform is we have to balance the budget that great to beat is seized that men and great beaches corolla feeding that's coming from the public is coded in with its czech chilled in the second world war with the wistful thinking off to the civil war sunday they are actually the safety car ronning destination and the fifteen e. u. and pushing it into operation that's basie what chilled hulking you're saying is happening to do yesterday and today we articulate their purposes and governing vision when the civil war began lincoln's carpets what's to say if the union only later after the enormous sacrifice at gettysburg in elsewhere did lincoln redefined the purpose of the civil war which was no freedom not union so upgrade leaders there to begin with a certain moral and political imagination and death but they deploy a those resources and that creativity articulating a steak au made by making sense to
