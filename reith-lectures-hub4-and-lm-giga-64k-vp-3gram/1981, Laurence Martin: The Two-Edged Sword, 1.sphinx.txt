mean they can discover no evidence that the rate of acquisition by one side determines that the other such behavioral could still be a problem at the very least to sound like a way to waste money but the metaphor of a race it seems hardly apt blind man's buff might be more suitable this however serious .point two which is that the remedies for the pros as suggested by one matches for would be very different from those implied by the other what the hey view would contract beat aptly compared to a race he did not seem quite the best when he took that enticed the fact that the percentage of american gross national product devoted to the millet tree fell from nine .point one percent in nineteen sixty that is before vietnam and the four president kennedy's stationing of nuclear forces fell from nine .point one percent to fight a .point two percent in nineteen eighty one with the miller to share the federal budget fell from forty nine percent to twenty three percent president reagan's much discussed rearmament program will get him to make it but that twenty three percent up to twenty four percent in nineteen eighty two admitted to the disproportionate foreign share of the federal budget is chiefly explained by the bost rising social expenditure in other words the military establishment has not shared in the rising american standard of living this during the seventies american defence expenditure fell in real terms by just under two percent a year the sums spent on the most frequently discussed strategic nuclear arms was only two thirds in the nineteen sixties when it had been in the nineteen fifties and only two thirds in the nineteen seventies when he convened in the nineteen sixties in this country british annual defense spending in real terms rose between five and ten percent to total between nineteen seventy three and nineteen eighty one disproportionate gross national product british defence spending actually fell from over eight percent in the early sixties

me be care and not asserting that any particular level of defence expenditure this procreate and eerie suggesting that the numbers i have been quitting are scarcely above the metaphor of a mixed

it has been we americans who lack almost every step of the road have taken the lead in the development of this sort of weaponry is is that best hop through in the hostage is true is not paid to the

innovation is back in a recent letter akai and inviting me a great many others to add to new care conference in the netherlands to retired american admiral jean de roca one of a small but not in danger species of randy miller to retired officers to plot the appearance of new nuclear weapons that he described as more precise and more devastating status of the subject was the element of the
