two ideas into a one way to reduce the indifference of the department of minister of will be to restructure the cabinet compete to create a high c'mon ,comma moldova wall cabinets of nineteen sixteen in nineteen thirty nine the cabinet will be a small closely knit group of senior ministers could be menu with upkeep lament responsibilities that were done that for having any prior commitment on any

deep amend tremendous is to decide is now which issues to cloud their approval but which did not but was a man to win to the cabinet to the department of minister would have less of a voice in the decision that he has now indicted will find himself having to start positions affecting his responsibilities which he did not agree on peace he would ask to be seen in public the attractions of the

he can trust the defect admissible fest will commit to dispatching business with that of a conventional cabernets de i'd have bet a family resemblance to a proposal made by the public and to the which reviewed the contra bobby chicks bended chess in nineteen sixty one in that instance the idea was to strengthen the hand of the trust of each check a mike creating a committee of cabinet ministers may

cabinet idea is free from the beef into the p. o. as its decisions would be final nevertheless set up awful objections to its share to himself was reluctant to have his war cabinet composed entirely of monday ,comma the ministers but he expressed the view that day did to become more and more theoretical supervises the commentary comes reading any menace amounted to an intraday but doubtful how to use their knowledge or don't do more harm than good i sympathize with this view in my experience of administration i shot it almost impossible to think and start to be about general policy issues if i not be involved in particular critical patients but also discussed with my fellow civil servants to crush to not give more attention to momentum problems we've considered does indeed diesel to report recommended putting the tosca strategic sinking could be given to tending munich's who'd be free from the kids a day to day administration but leave usually concluded that only by being involved in everyday issues can be tried in different along the time general problems and construction corps solutions you all are a i see a real possibility that the cabinet at a tulsa ministers without portfolio and individual members would tend to become specialists in certain areas one minister mike took us on foreign policy while social policy and sell the deep up mental minister would then identified the relevant cabinet member whose entrust missed with his while to catch keady indict touched deep amend or presentations and supplied a bus or a bomb in a briefing or target ,comma department's side gradually what might emerge would be a collection of super deep amend a minister's rather like the oval twitched it to devise to his peacetime administration in nineteen fifty one that was not by any means a success it may be that in time of war when there's a single overriding aim to be pursued the idea is hobbled but i'm due to the conclusion reduction to putting peacetime than the government has many different objectives begin a candidate concept would not be a satisfactory solution to the problem and identified another less radical approach to cabinet reform might be to develop a system of cabinet committees new committees to be set up to reduce the citic issues like housing social services ,comma spoke the functioning of the nationalized industries and so they could accommodate the minister's debakey and told to kill the number who had no relevant deep augment responsibilities that composition would enable them but i do with the seattle field of policy the dorset to insure that the minister's function in both went up and away by the departments of lobbyists but it would also be their job to relate the policy yet would do that in a few good government rolled up political objectives and that image is a lot to the polished function this review board is a strategic kimonos to wed strategy will fight for real misleading the sometimes incorporated in the title list of them have been preoccupied with the kind of pace work with is that a regular indeed fit into the top mental consultation and coordination when the government of the day as head of prices and incomes posted for instance the cabinet committee has been set up to ten individual problems and crenshaw consistency of abdication by cool developments extruded committees have been established as a walk off misha to review particular policies and to produce a report that this is be more common at the official than at the ministerial level i cannot recall any government systematically establishing cabinet committees with the purposes and names like described it to be a fair question to us whether i would like to see such a committee operating in the field of financial and economic policy while i was a bitter three pianist also has to be the tightest and integrate the sub's but i'm sure wood trusses are said to would have done to but i have to concede that it would be an exodus of into the country in the appellate court could have come from the independent scrutiny of our assumptions and troops in the wooded and much to get not tricia munis is a greater sense of participation in the management of the economy by a tree you commit to might be able to coordinate the various facets of the policy to issue was responsible and live to see the will of the relevant departments and that could cut them would not necessarily help in the integration of government policy is a hull nobody bid at the level of cabinet can do that but i do really is that the idea that the review committee is extending relates to my age society would be to produce an annual report to cabinet would do quite a lot to make the cabinet into a more corporate bond desert courses schoolwork which was to cross from cement but which are usually should friendship knowledge of the british cabinet as we know it is not a book where takako mobbed the school would like to develop still further the notion of the prime minister's he and a person in charge of government policy as a whole at n. c. and a person who can determine priorities to rely as this concept in full the prime minister would need a department of the devices in much the same way that the american president has his only if the source asked any executive offices of the white house but getting the prime minister the response of energy and the means to toward a policy toward priorities and to challenge in detail the proposals of individual departments they did it scored to reconcile with the principle of collective responsibility as we know it's will be taking a significant step toward a presidential form of government with a single chief executive advised assisted by the comments were the sheep's the prime minister would have the power to impose his will on a cabinet in a way we have never known even in war but added it would begin to resemble the medics who kept the shoes that more than a consultative body to the president those who would like to see the prime ministry assumed great to respond to that used on you that he's already in a dominating position he alone is about to appoint

involvement of the prime minister in what used to be purely depot mental effects finally in general the actions of this seems something of a connecticut all presidential contests is spite of these developments by billy the kid that remains the supreme governing baltic and i believe it's right that it should be prime ministers and top white residents it eight to buy darted openness suffrage indeed within the past fifty years for most of the prime ministers have taken office without having won a general election more importantly the fact that the power to take decisions on major policy resides in the cabinet in march and the brightest unloaded a four by just who the valuable constitutional check prime ministers have to take account of cabinet revolts and kept middle position and that represents a cross section of the majority party and its decisions in my view it more likely to come on parliament to support the decisions of the prime minister to lead for the series this i would not favor any further strengthening of the prime minister's position in relation to his colleagues or list suggests that despite the weaknesses of evidence is a collective instituting are no easy institutional alternatives to what we have a person but before i got my second suggestion i want to do with an issue which is being widely consist of the last two years yet give the prime minister within the prison chartres cabinet government and private to the role he's already a quiet could have a star for the second without such stars as the argument is the prime minister is at the lesser of the deep ,comma and a minister and his advice is butler rapidly become a creature of the people and make a brief item ever being dissuaded by this argument is the prime augusta has been torn

do indicate darted to the number ten that gets this unhappy situation began her courage it could be an indication of a fundamentally unhealthy situation cabinet which should really be resold by other means and the creation of the prime minister's department so that i thought she'd be to the conclusion that with the possible exception of a cabinet review committees we are likely to permit strategic decision taking by reforming the system of government where is it that we should be looking for improvement i think the also lies in some strength in the post office which serves the cabinet to solve this government is now all the guys the cabernets hesitates ames said his and the cabinet secretariat this is a tiny star headed by the cabinet secretary finished august appendage anderson compiler
