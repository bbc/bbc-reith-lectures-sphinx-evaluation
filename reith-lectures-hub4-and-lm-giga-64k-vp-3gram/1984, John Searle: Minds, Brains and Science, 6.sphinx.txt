this is a taut cost and the talk i sit at the b. c. to take tests this late in the series and my aim is the brains and science get in by tell sell with a russian april coast in nineteen eighty full in these lectures i have tried to answer what ought to meet some of the most worrisome questions about how we as human beings that into the rest of the universe are conception of ourselves as free agents is fundamental to our whole are also conception now ideally i would like to be able to keep both mike commonsense conceptions and my scientific beliefs in the case of the relation between mind and body for example i was able to do that but when it comes to the question of freedom and determined as some eye ailment like a lot of other philosophers unable to reconcile the two one would think that after over two thousand years of worrying about it the problem of the freedom of the will would by now and then finally solved well actually most philosophers think it has been sold basinger was sought by thomas hobbes and david hume and various other impair u. reminded philosophers whose solutions have been repeated that improved right into the twentieth century i think it has not been solved in this lecture i want to give you an account of what the problem is and why they can temper a solution is not a solution and then conclude by trying to explain why the problem is likely to stay with us on a one a and we're inclined to say that since nature consists of particles and their relations with each other and since everything can be accounted for in terms of those particles and their relations there is simply no room for freedom of the whale as far as human freedom is concerned it doesn't matter whether physics as determined as steak has new tone in physics was or whether it allows for random assert indeterminate sea at the level of particle physics as can tempering quantum mechanics god's indeterminate them at the level of particles and fits a ickes is really no support at all to any doctrine of the freedom of the whale because first the statistical indeterminate sea at the level of particles does not show any indeterminate seat at the level of the objects that matter to us human bodies for example and secondly even if there is an element of indeterminate see in the behavior of physical particles even if they are only statistically predictable stealth that by itself it gives no scope for human freedom of the whale it doesn't follow from the fact that particles are only statistically determined that the human mind can force the best that his big league determined particles to swerve from their parents this strong eskin age for conveying this conception of determine ism is still that formulated by le clos if an ideal observer knew the positions of all the particles in a given instant and knew all the laws governing their movements he could predict and wrecked or date the entire history of the universe some other predictions of a contemporary quantum chemical up loss might be statistical but they would still allow no room for freedom of the will but so much that the appeal of determine is some now let's turn to the argument for the freedom of the will as many philosophers have pointed out if there isn't any effective experience that we are all familiar with it the simple fact about our own choices decisions reasoning zen kaji occasions seemed to make a difference or actual behavior there are all sorts of experiences that we have in life or it seems just a fact of our experience that all we did one thing we know or at least think we know perfectly well that we could have done something else we know we could've done something else because we chose one thing for certain reasons but we were aware that there were also reasons for choosing something else any indeed we might have acted on those reasons and chosen that something else another way to put this point is to say it's just a plain empirical fact about our behavior that aid is unpredictable in the way that the behavior of objects rolling down any inclined plane is predictable and the reason it is unpredictable and backed away is that we could often do otherwise then we in fact did human freedom is just a fact of experience and if we want some empirical proof of this fact we can simply point to the further fact that it's always hopped a bus stop falsify heaney productions that anybody might care to make about our behavior if somebody predicts that i'm going to do something i might just damn well do something else now that sort of auction is simply not cold and the glaciers moving down mountainsides or balls rolling down inclined planes or the planets moving in their elliptical orbits this is a characteristic philosophical conundrum in the one hand is set up barry powerful arguments forces to the conclusion that free whale has no place in the universe on the other hand this series of powerful arguments based on facts of our own experience inclines us to the conclusion that there must be some freedom of the will because we all experience at all the time that as a standard solution to this philosophical conundrum according to the solution three whelan determine ism are perfectly compatible with each other of course according to the solution everything in the world is determined but some actions are nonetheless freed to say that they are freed is not to deny that they are determined it's just to say that they are not constrained were not forced to do them so free sample if a man is forced to do something at gunpoint or if he's suffering from some psychological compulsion than his bader is genuinely in free epiphany other hand he freely acts if he acts as we say in his own free will then his behavior is free of course it's also completely determined since every aspect of his behavior is determined by the physical forces operating in the particles that compose his body as they operate on all of the bodies in the universe sol according to this view free behavior exists but is just a small corner of the determined world it's a back corner of determine behavior were certain kinds of force and compulsions are absent now be caught in this view asserts that compatibility of free will and determined as them it's usually called simply compatible issam i think it's inadequate as a solution to the problem and here's why the problem about the freedom of the wheel is not about whether or not there are intersects a logical reasons that cause us to do things as well as external physical causes and inner compulsions rather it's about whether or not the causes of our behavior whenever they are are sufficient to determine the behavior so that things have to happen the way they do happen and there's another way to put this problem is it ever true to say of a person's that he could have done otherwise all other conditions remaining the same free sample given that a person chose to vote for the tories could he have chosen to vote for one of the other parties all other conditions remaining the same now compatible ism doesn't really answer that question in a way that allows any scope put the ordinary notion of the freedom of the whale what it says is that all behavior is determining in such a way that it couldn't have occurred otherwise all other conditions remaining the same everything that happened was indeed determined it's just that some things were determined by certain sorts of inner psychological causes those which we call our reasons for acting and not by external forces or psychological compulsions so we're still left with a problem is that it ever true to say of a human being that he could have done otherwise compatible ism inshore denies this absence of free will quell maintaining its verbal shell well then let's try to make a fresh start to buy a set that we have a conviction of our own free will simply based on the facts of human experience but perhaps our belief that such experiences support the doctrine of human freedom is you lose your consider this sort of example at tactical hypnosis experiment has the following form under hypnosis that patient is given up most hypnotic suggestion you can tell him free sample to do some fairly trivial harmless things such as wet sake crawl around on the floor now after the patient comes out of hypnosis he might be engaging in conversations sitting drinking coffee when sadly he says something like what fascinates floor in this room are how i'd check out this rogge are i'm thanking of investing in floor coverings and i'd like to investigate the coverings on this floor and he then proceeds to crawl around on the floor now the interest in these cases is that the patient up always gives some moral lesson adequate reason for doing what he does that he is he seems to himself to be beating freely we on the other a and have good reasons to believe that his behavior isn't free at all that the reasons he gives frias apparent decision to crawl around on the floor perrier relevant betty's bader was determined in advance that he is in short in the grip of opposed hypnotic suggestion now waterway tap pose a problem of determining assemble at least one important aspect of the problem of determined his and he is is all human behavior like that but now if we take that example seriously it looks as if it proves to be an argument for the freedom of the whale and are against the the agents thought he was acting freely though in fact his behavior was determined but it seems impair a clique very unlikely that all human behaviors like that sometimes people are indeed suffering from the effects of hypnosis and sometimes we know that they're in the grip of unconscious urges which they cannot control by late always like that is all human beggar determined by such psychological compile chums beth piece as a psychological determinants of is that cry or psychological causes determine all of our behavior in the way that they determine the behavior of the hypnosis subject or that heroin addict in this new all behavior in one way or another is psychologically compulsive but the available evidence suggests that such a thesis is fall's we do indeed normally act on the basis of mark intentional states arba leaves hopes fears desires and sought at a match since our mental states function casale but this form of cause and effect relations is not determined a stick when my dad had exactly those mental states had still not have done what we did instances up hypnosis and psychologically compulsive behavior on the one and are usually pathological and easily distinguishable from normal free action on the other so psychologically speaking there does seem to be scope for human freedom but is this illusion really an advance on compatible issam art we jest staying once again yes hauled a year is determined but what we call free beg your business or determined by rational thought process sometimes the conscious rational thought processes don't make any difference as in the hypnosis kazan sometimes they do as in the normal kids but of course the most normal rational thought processes are as much determined as anything else so once again donned we are the result that everything we do was entirely written in the book of history begins there years before we were barred and therefore nothing we do is free in a neat philosophically interesting sends if we choose to call our bait here three that's just a matter of adopting a traditional terminology just as we continue to speak of sun sets even though we know perfectly well that the sound docile literally sat sell eight continued to speak up acting of our own free will even though there is no such phenomena what a way to examine a philosophical thesis or any other kind of a thesis on that matter is that ask what difference would it make how what the world be any different if that pieces were true as opposed to how the world would be if that thesis were false not part of the appeal of determined ism i believe is that it seems to be consistent with the way the world infect proceeds at least as far as we know anything about it from physics that its if determined as a more true that the world would proceed pretty much the way it does proceed the only difference being that certain of our beliefs about its proceedings would be false but if libertarian ism that is the thesis of three whales were true it appears we would have to make some really radical changes in our beliefs about the world in order for us to have a radical freedom than it looks as if we would have to pass a late pit inside each of us was the self that was capable of interfering with the cars will order of nature that he is it looks as if we would have to contain some into the bed was capable of making molecules swerve from their path this i don't know if such a view is even intelligible but it's certainly not consistent with what we know about how the world works from physics and that's not the slightest evidence to suppose that we should abandon physical fear or he didn't favor of such a view well self are then we seem to be getting exactly nowhere in our effort to resolve the conflict between determined as some and a belief in the freedom of the whale science seems to allow no place for freedom of the whale and indeterminate summoned physics offers no support for the freedom of the well on the other hand we seem to be unable to get out the belief that the freedom of the well so let's investigate both of these points out that further why exactly is there no room for the freedom of the whale on a contemporary scientific view the universe are basic explanatory mechanisms in physics work from the bottom up that is to say we explain the behavior of surface features of a phenomenon such as the transparency of glass or the liquidity of water in terms of the ban hater of micro particles such as molecules and the relation of the mine to the brain is an example of satcher relations but we get causation from the mine to the body that is we get top down causation over up passage of time and we get top down causation overtime because that top level and the bottom level go together so free sample suppose i want to cause the release of the narrow transmitter pass settle colina at the exxon and plates of my motor nor ron's now i can do that by simply deciding to raise my arm and then are raising it here as a mental advantage the intention to raise my arm causes the physical events the release of a settle culling and that's the case of top down causation if ever there was one but such cases have topped downed causation only work because the mental events are grounded in the narrow physiology to start with some corresponding to the description of the causal re lay shuns the dough from the top of the bottom this another description of the same series of events where they causal relations ballots entirely along the bottom that he is they are entirely a matter of neurons and oran firings at said axes and so on as long as we accept this conception of how nature works many doesn't seem that there's any scope for the freedom of the whale because on this conception dopamine can only ethic nature in so far as it is already up part of nature but excelled that like the rest of nature its features are determined that the basic a micro level so physics this is actually an absolutely fundamental point in his lecture so let me repeat that the farm and determine a sum that is ultimately worrisome is not psychological determines the idea that our state of mind are sufficient to determine everything we do what is probably just false though worry some form of determined ism is more basic and fundamental since all of this surface features of the world are entirely caused by it and realize the systems of micro elements than the behavior of micro elements is sufficient to determine everything that happens said job bottom out picture of the world allows for top down causation harm mines for example ,comma affect our bodies but that top down causation only works because that top level is already caused by u. n. are realized and na bottom levels well then let's turn to the next obvious question why he isn't about our experience that makes it impossible for us to abandon a belief in the freedom of the wheel if freedom is an illusion why is it an illusion we seem unable to abandon the first thing i notice about our conception of human freedom is that eighties essentially tied adcock just last week only attribute freedom to conscious b. yates set us free sample somebody builder robot which we believe to be totally unconscious in such a case we would never feel in the inclination to call it free even if we found it's behavior random and unpredictable we would not say that it was acting freely in the sense that we think of ourselves as acting freely if in other hands somebody build a robot that we became convinced that consciousness in the same sense that we do then india would at least be an open question whether or not that robot have freedom of the whale this second point to note is that it is not just any state of consciousness that gives us the conviction of human freedom if life consisted entirely of the reception of passive perceptions that it seems to me we would never so much as for the idea of human freedom if you're a matching yourself totally immobile totally unable to move and on a ball to determine even the course of your own thoughts but still are receiving stimuli for example sake periodic motley painful sensations there when not in such a case be the slightest inclination to conclude that you have freedom of the whale i said earlier that most phosphorus thinks that the conviction of human freedom is somehow essentially tied to the process a rational decision making but i think that's only partly true in fact away hangout for reasons it is only a very special case of the experiences that give us the conviction of freedom that characteristic experience that gives us the conviction of human freedom and it is an experience from which we are unable to strip away the conviction of freedom is the experience of engaging involuntary intentional human actions now reads that sort of experience which is the foundation stone of our belief in the freedom of the wheel y. reflect very carefully on the character of the experience is you have as you engage in normal every day of ordinary human actions you will assess the possibility of alternative courses of action built into these experiences if you raise your arm or walk across the room or take a drink of water you will see that it any point in the experience you have a sense of alternative courses of action open to you if one tried to express it in words the difference be twin the experience of perceiving and experience that acting is that him perceiving one has the sense this is happening to me buddy act acting one has the sense i am making this happen but the sense that i am making this happen carries with it a sense i could be doing something else in our own behavior each thing we do carries the conviction now let auriemma ballot that we could be doing something else right here and now that he is all other conditions remaining the same as the s. i. said it is the source of our unshakeable conviction in our own free will is perhaps important emphasize that i'm discussing normal human action if one is in the grip of a great passion for example if one is in the grip of a great rage one loses this sense of freedom that one can even be surprised to discover what one is doing now what we noticed this feature of the experience of acting a great deal of it has linked phenomenon i mentioned earlier is easily explained why free sample do we feel that the man in a case of post hypnotic suggestion is not acting freely in the sense in which we are even though he might think that he is acting freely whether reason is that in an important sense he doesn't know what he's doing his actual intention inaction is totally unconscious the options that he sees as available to him are here are relevant to the actual motivation of his behavior notice also that the compatible list examples of so called forced or compelled behavior steel in many cases involve the experience of freedom if free sample and instructed to walk across the room at gunpoint still part of the experience is that i sense there is a literally open to me at a nice step to do something else the experience of freedom is bassett essential component of it in a case of acting with an intention again you can see this as you contrast than normal case in action with a pair of field cases where stimulation of the motor cortex produces any involuntary movements of the arm or leg in such a case that the patient would experience the movement passively as he would experience a sound or a sensation of pain and lanky intentional actions there are no options built into this experience to see this point clearly tried lamented that a portion of your life was like the penfield experiments on a grand scale instead of walking across the room you simply find that your body is moving across the room instead was speaking you simply hear and feel words coming out of your mouth imagine your experiences are bozo of pure lead passive but conscious pop that and you will have imagined away the experience of freedom but in a typical case of intentional action there's no way we can carve up off the experience of freedom it is an essential part of the experience of acting this also explains i believe why we cannot give up our conviction of freedom we find it easy enough to give up the conviction that the earth is flat as soon as we understand the evidence of a he leo sentry syria the solar system similarly when we look at us and said in spite of appearances we do not feel compelled to believe that the sun is setting behind the earth we believe that the appearance of this sounds setting is simply an illusion created by the rotation of the earth in each case it is possible to give up a common sense conviction because the hypothesis that replaces that both accounts for the experiences that led to that conviction in the first place as well as explaining how a lot of other facts that the commonsense view is unable to account for now that's why we give up the belief that a flatter and literal sunsets in favor of backup koernke and conception of the solar system but we can't similarly give out the conviction of freedom because of that conviction is built into every normal conscious intentional action and indeed we used this conviction in identifying and explaining actions we cannot draw the conclusions that are implicit in this discussion first if no worry about determinants of is a worry that all of our behavior is in fact psychologically compulsive than it appears that the worry is unwarranted insofar as psychological determined issam is just an impure ecole hypothesis like any other than the evidence we presently have available to us suggests is falls sold this does give us a modified form of compatible as some he gives us the view that psychological libertarian issam is compatible with physical determined as second lady in the event gives us a sense of could have in which people's behavior so determined is such that in that sense they could've done otherwise this sense is simply that as far as the psychological factors were concerned they could've done otherwise the notions of ability of what we're able to do and what we could've donna are often are relative to some sections set of criteria friesz sample i caught a floated for carter in the nineteen eighty american election even if i didn't buy could not have voted for george washington he was not a candidate so there's a sense of court ahead of in which there were a range of choices available to me and in vaccines are a lot of things i could've done all other things being equal which i did not infect do not settle elite because the psychological factors operating on meat do not always or even in general compelled me to behave in a particular fashion i often psychologically speaking could have done something different from what i did in fact do but third in this farm of compatible ism still does not give us anything like the resolution of the conflict between freedom and determined as some that are urged to radical libertarian issam really dumais ends as long as we accept the bottom up conception of physical explanation beta conception in which the past three hundred years of science is based in psychological facts about ourselves like any other higher level facts are entirely caso weeks split double in terms of an entirely realized in systems of elements that the fundamental micro physical level our conception of physical reality simply does not allow for radical freedom for the final eight for reasons that i don't really understand the evolution has given us a form of experience of voluntary action where the experience of freedom that is to say the experience of this sense of alternative possibilities is built into the very structure of conscious involuntary intentional human behavior for that reason i believe me that this discussion nor any other will ever convince us that our behavior is on three by a minis lecturers has been to try rider characterize the relationships between the conception that we have of ourselves as a rational free conscious mindful agents with a conception that we have of the world as consisting of mindless meaningless physical particles it's tempting to think that just as we have discovered that large portions of common sense do not adequately represent how the world really works so we might also discover that our conception of ourselves and our behavior is entirely false but there are limits on this possibility the distinction between reality and appearance can not apply to them very existence of consciousness for a kid seems to me that i'm conscious that i am conscious we did discover all kinds of startling things about ourselves that our behavior but we cannot discover that we do not have mines that they do not contain conscious subjective intentional wispy mental states nor could we discovered that we do not at least tried to engage in voluntary intentional actions the problem i set myself is not to prove the existence of these things but to examine their status and their implications for our conceptions of the rest of nature by general theme has been that with certain important exceptions are work commonsense conception of ourselves is perfectly consistent with our conception of nature as a physical system it then listening to it and tossed in the i. a. said the b. b. c. at least a chance to mold our costs to states to take the b.
