doctors routinely make decisions to make judgments this much :colon put its but what sort of judgment so decisions ought to be the media to drive most people would be did a judgment based only technical skill in trading of to talk to i cannot agree doctors make decisions as to what looks to be done some but only some of these decisions on matters of technical skill that he is based on the observation of objective facts in the abdication of particular skills in the light of such facts i said that a majority of decisions taken by doctors and all technical they are instead of moral and ethical day decisions about what looks to be done in the light of certain values nellis creates a problem doctors claim a special indeed unique called attention a particular area to practice it registered two medical judgment spectacle decisions before then and a modem that if i write to ditch a fundamental feature of medical practice to doctors and making ethical judgments it means that a six to the extent that they touch on how doctors choose to practice medicine blossomed into the end and an eleven this surprising and even dangerous nation that would normally be accepted or dicicco principle was the principal by reference to which we organize our lives and decide what we will watch a world not to do a lot to preserve living iwan group but to doctor where imply that yes he does

they uniquely competent to do doctors are not unique to competent to make a sequel decision to receive more training to prepare them for such a role so quick to rather bluntly what i'm calling for a wholesale reexamination of the sphere of lake's competence of the doctor if you agree with me as i take you to some examples that doctors are indeed making musical decisions in a row that haphazardly delisting critic way than you want to consider how best we should respond when they seek to insisted doctors conform to standards and principles set down my oldest when they suggested the education of doctors to pay the more appropriately for the decision was a cold on tonight we may be content merely to remind them that they must look over their shoulders from time to time to make sure we approve what they're doing in life but i assured doctors will recognize the truth in what un suggested it's just that they seem to operate in some form of the automatic pilot when he comes to matters of the six we must gain their attention and provide the correct navigation takes the following proposition you don't freak out a consumer of homicide in the exceptions to it to be inactive for doctors alone

turned to its decided at the council will not respond to treatment and to die within a matter of weeks or months given that such predictions are based guesses to question the data arrives in the mind of the doctors what to tell her sure to tell the truth about the condition or offer some alternative story which is perhaps more optimistic the sum to switch an ally these christians are up to this people do it one to die not to delay a one to know their daughter nor could they tolerate being told that dying nor did they know that our sung or utilities assumption is maybe we'll founded a publication that debt and supported by any of the tips they reflected the anxiety is that the healthy infect what surveys there are shows that the large majority of patients with the total cancer would prefer to know the truth by contrast doctors ordinarily choose not to tell us the most important assumption underlying the question of what to tell a patient is addict did talk to who is unique because it tried to decide what the patient should have the course once the deal is allowed that patients do not want to know the truth rationalizations can readily be created which served to justified the position the national adaptation doesn't wish to know soon becomes the patient should in no one argument :colon they use it to the diagnoses is in such a study published in nineteen sydney against rated at uncertainty of the diagnosis was not the reason for withholding information that was used to justify it the best take the nation for known communication was uncertain to look to build a diagnosis but over how much each patient wished tuna and certain to largely produced by the doctors and anxieties that doctors realized that some patients may indeed wish to know the truth that sings without our skiing they couldn't know which patients they managed to probe limped by not telling anyone this later provided the ideal coping mechanism for the doctor to buddy amended that to the patient who is not to kill it who insisted on a truce and was confident enough to be persistent got his way up another rationalization resorted to is this a cold therapeutic privilege to suggest it is a master of good medical practice soccer star suzy system which the doctor may withhold information from the patient is in the exercise his discretion in judgment it wouldn't be in the best interests of the patient's health tonight is to devise created by doctors to do what is in the best interest of doctors it may be justified on some occasions but does know if the discussion friday situation everything proceeds on the basis of the particular doctors' judgment be dual boils down to the doctor being cool and gentle and kind it will be nice to fool adult to elect its adjusting case current we have some more certain guarantees that our interests as different bypassed may be allowed to prevail the device of the therapeutic privilege pays lip service to the principles of truth telling and stilted termination what a great to discretionary exception which is quite capable of swallowing these principles when the doctor decides he occasionally quotient if we'll be in the fees rationalizations weise geodesic open the bill which is certainly not part of received dish and in our allies in the dock to patient village in the traditional view is that the doctor patient alicia ship brescia and trust were placed on agreement but what we see is an operational principal de fined by the doctor and accepted by a spiky fuld which allows the doctor to

extent of his full switching has a cast not so the doctor he remains a bobby toured the relationship even to the extent of taming the privilege of resorting to an operational principal which is the

you would be content to leave things as they are despite a far reaching significance of some of the decisions taken will let me take you a little for the meet pressed the point that decisions taken by doctors are of such nature does it take should exist on the college's scrunched tuesday island not to look not to specific examples but across a whole area of medical practice that concern with reproduction than but i want to identify for using ethical principles by reference to which bashir rendition is practiced you may not as easily recognized decisions which are taken as being part of traditional doctoring they seemed far more clearly focused to take rather leave to the dock to elude perhaps when you heard what i suggest you do more to take to accept my thesis that doctors are involved in making decisions which are more than technical data sickle decisions about dust because they affect our lives that made it out threatens to agreed principles they invested great power in the dock to and they every guarded at least by doctors as you need to attend a competent to make such a dead art is not easily checked so next turn to medical practice concerned the reproduction and this that they could to suggest other contexts in which medicine is an old theme which decisions are made by doctors will do is reduce abortion then listed deepen to severely handicapped newly born babies which i've already mentioned then dished a screening of pregnant mothers in the tissues to ride into fried deviations from the chairs and a warm this the provision of genetic counseling to

get does an extraordinary and difference in how this can send him to stand in strict on the one hand it's seemed to be reflected in the doctor's decision to sterilize the mentally retarded go before

to the power of doctors to operate as one right to point out that it did in the case for a jump of abortion doctors operate a system of screening of women which has nothing at all to do with the legal

specializing in the field of genetics have found themselves more more parlayed into d. c. a sickle difficult through the development of fecal screening they've been able to discover more more about
