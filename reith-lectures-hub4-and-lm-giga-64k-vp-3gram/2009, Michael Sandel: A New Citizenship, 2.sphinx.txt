in knots are back in the late nineteen seventies i still had separate colleges for men and women in the women's colleges had rules against overnight neo guests eased rules were rarely enforced and easily violated were so i was told pressure was growing to relax these rules which became a subject to debate its scene ends which was banned in all women's college somebody older women on the faculty were traditionalist they oppose allowing male guests they believed in protecting the moral virtue as they sought out their young women students at times he changed into traditionalist were embarrassed to get the real reasons for their objection to the translated their moral arguments into in economic warmth if men stay overnight they argued that costs to the college will increase probably you might wonder well instead dealt what it takes babson that would use outlawed are furthermore they argued that will have to replacing mattresses more often non the reformers met these documents by adopting the following compromise each moment could have a maximum of three overnight guests each week provided each guest page fifty pence and night to defray the costs to the college the next day the headline in the guardian red sea against rose fifty pence in nineteen last so there you have a lesson in this perilous opry do sing morrow considerations to economic ones my seeming east lectures tenderly using new citizenship in this lecture my subject is morality in politics and not referring here to them a relative politicians i'm referring instead to the role that morrow and religious arguments should play in political discourse and justifying last many people shot irked at the prospect is dangerous desk to bring morality and religion into politics is not safe for for government to try to be neutral and avoid taking sides in the moral and religious convictions that citizens espouse i see no not necessarily for two reasons first it's often not possible for government to be neutral on substantive moral questions and second the attempt to do so can make for an impoverished public discourse that need to get where i left off last time with a case about buying and selling some couples are out on a cable to bear children if their own but they don't want to adopt a one to genetically related child so they provide the egg and sperm and high euro woman to carry the

paid pregnancy is now up all sorts to low cost providers in two thousand and two india legalize commercial surrogacy in hopes of attracting foreign customers indian home by an obstetrician who recently told the london evening standard that she delivers an average one baby from a surrogate for british couple every forty eight hours from the standpoint of market efficiency all sourcing pregnancy to women in the developing world makes perfect sense the money the women returned around seventy five hundred dollars is often more than they would meet in fifteen years for the prospective parents hiring and indian woman to bear their child is a great bargain the total cost is about a third of what it would be in britain or in the united states every win games in depth is something unsettling about this new global industry one source of unease may get down about ten cents to the women freely chosen to bear other people's babies for paying for it takes to turn to it in effect by force if property and economic necessity that even if we're satisfied that the arrangement is not coercive there remains a further morrow question about ten cents but about the degradation does treating babies and pregnant seeks as commodities degrade them to suit fails to values and in the right way elisabeth henderson a moral philosopher has supplied a version of this idea to the surrogacy debate she argues that surrogacy contracts degraded women and children by treating them as if they were commodities and by degradation she means creating something in accordance with a lower motives valuation than is proper to it commercial surrogacy degrades children she argues because it uses them as instruments of profit rather than cherishes them this person is worthy of love and care if also degrades women andersen argues bike feeding their bodies as factories and by paying them not to bond with the children they bear the surrogates labor is the lyonnais did anderson writes because she

that goes all the way back to aristotle money gives you a very brief summary of aristotle is fury of justice justice means giving people what they do serve that it is my summer hit aristotle to just to not of course who deserves what depends on a kind of thing being distributed software settles this suppose we're distributing flukes who should get the best ones his answer to that took place while not the most obvious leasing you make the sinking is that this will result in the best music making everybody better off a decision that aristotle teresa he thinks the best mode should go to the best look layers because that's what foods are for to be played well the percussive flutes and musical performance generally used to produce excellent music it is also top honor and recognize those who are great musicians that's why the best musicians should get the best flukes in this case seems to lease the most people would agree that flutes are for the sake of producing music that happens is people disagree about the purpose of the activity in question is if possible to rescind about the purposes of social practices in the face of disagreement aristotle believes that it gets that i think he's right now let's share from flutes to golf here is aimed at arista kealy and store in about a controversy over golf casey martin was a professional golfer with a bad light he had a circulatory disorder in so watching the golf course for eighteen holes cost him considerable pain and pose a serious risk of fracture despite his disability casey martin was an excellent golfer he asked the p. g. a.'s the professional golfers association for permission to use a golf cart during tournaments they said helped martin took his case to court yet argued that the law about disability accommodation the americans with disabilities act require reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities provided it is the last said that the change did not fundamentally alter the nature of the activity that is aloha some of the biggest names in golf testified in the case of arnold palmer jack nicklaus ken venturi ault offended the band on carts they argued that the key is an important factor in tournament golf in the writing rented a mocking would be no interred at leave it or not the case went all the way to the united states supreme court but interesting about the case is that asked the justices wrestled with the data found themselves facing impairs duty being questioned to court had to determine the essential nature of the activity in question is walking the course is essential to golf or merely incidental to resort to a question about casey martin is rights the court had determined that her best for the essential nature of the game but he supposed to decide that dealt the court ruled seven to two that cheesy martin had arrived music off cars the court concluded that accommodating his disability by letting him riding a cart would not fundamentally alter the game which was the justices concluded mainly about making shots of trying to get the ball into a very small life after all was a conflict over the golf cart really about on the surface it is about fairness but if fairness we the only thing at stake there would've been an easy and obvious solution left all golfers use carts in the tournaments that dissolution was anathema to professional golf even more if it unthinkable that making an exception for casey martin while because the tissue was less about fairness than about honor and recognition specifically the desires of the p. g. a. concoct golfers that their sport you recognized and respected as an athletic effect lightning quick to point b. as delicately as possible golfers are somewhat sensitive about the status of their game it involves no running or jumping and the ball stands still and no one doubts that office demanding game its skillful but the honor and recognition accorded great golfers dependence on their sport being seen as a physically demanding athletic competition if the game in which they excel can be played while riding in a cart iraqi their recognition that has athletes could be questioned or diminish self up who's ever writes about the essential nature of golf the federal cases over casey martin's cart postures of powerful new inspiration of aristotle sport debates about rights are often unavoidable and debates about the purpose of social institutions tidbits they allocate and the virtues it under and award let's turn now to a hotly contested contemporary issue to question its namesake marriage if a prominent issue in united states several american states now permit gay marriage many others allow for civil unions or civil partnerships beazer arrangements that stopped short of marriage to grant legal protections inheritance rights hospital visitation rights child custody arrangements in song to unmarried partners of the same sex who live together so here's the question should the state to recognize gay marriage on the same basis is married to print a man and woman something it will say yes and argue for same sex marriage and what they claim are neutral non judgmental grounds where their when personally approves or disapproves of gay and lesbian relationships individual should be free to choose their marital partners now if this argument is a sufficient basis for recordings gave recognition to same sex marriage ban its true issue can be resolved without entering into controversies about the purpose of marriage and tomorrow status of homosexual relationships that the case for same sex marriage had been made on neutral words not judgmental grownups years while the debate over same sex marriage is fundamentally dependent about whether gay and lesbian unions are worthy of the honor and recognition that in our society state sanctioned marriage can first so the underlying moral question is unavoidable to see why this is so upbeat seem portal to bear in mind that the state can take three possible positions toward marriage not just to first became recognized marriage only between a man and a woman though perhaps offering gay men and lesbians sipple partnerships as the new k. currently does that policy wonk or policy to it and recognize same sex marriage on individual basis with heterosexual marriage as my home state of massachusetts is don or freeze it could decline to recognize marriage of any kind and leave this road to private associations and religious communities of the foreign policy is purely -hyphen better coped as far as i know no stage our country has renounced marriage with the government function but policy three is the ideal libertarian solution to the merits of that he doesn't abolish marriage to the dozen polish marriage is a state sanctioned institution michael kinsley and opinion journalist with libertarian sympathies to face this policy this third option is a way out of what he sees as a hopeless argument over marriage dissolution kinsley writes is to end the institution of government sanctioned marriage were deprived of thais marriage is how he puts it quote that churches and other religious institutions continue to offer marriage ceremonies like department stores and casino's kidded that he acted a lot to us that three people and get married or one person wants to marry her self and seminoles flats to conduct a ceremony in declare that married letter best case would totally proposes it ineffective replaces tossed a sanction marriages gay and straight when civil partnerships fell relatively few people in either side of the same sex marriage to date have been braced to dis establishment proposal but this third option helps us see why proponents and opponents of same sex marriage must contend with the substantive morrow and latest controversy about the purpose of marriage and the virtues it honors menil defender rhett has seen six marriage tried to wrest their claim on neutral grounds to avoid passing judgment on the moral meaning of marriage in this attempt draws heavily on the ideas of nondiscrimination and freedom of detroit's did his ideas can't write themselves justified the right if freedom of choice for all that matters the state would have no grounds for limiting marriage to two persons consensual polygamous partnerships would also qualified cabinet to stay really wanted to be neutral and respect whatever choice as individuals wish to make you would have to adopt in sleaze proposal and get out of the businesses of conferring recognition in any messages this would be the equivalent in the case of marriage up netting a hefty one ride in a golf cart that he chose the real issue in the gay marriages .period dyslexia in its bow whether same sex unions are worthy of honor and recognition by the community where didn't fulfill the purpose of the social institution of marriage properly understood the massachusetts court that became the first quarter and united states to require recognition of same sex marriage understood at this point of the court gave him not to neutrality and freedom of choice he made clear that it did not intend to open the way to polygamous marriage nor to call for the appalachian offered this establishment of marriage chief justice margaret marshall wrote the canyon for the court in making the case she stepped outside the bounds of little neutrality to affirm the moral worth of same sex unions and to offer it to you about the purpose of marriage properly understood more than a private arrangement between two consenting adults she wrote marriage is a form of public recognition and approval in a real sense there are three parkas to every civil marriage to willing spouses and an approving state if marriages and honorific institution which virtues to sit on our to ask this question is to ask about the purpose of marriage and this is really the heart of the dispute opponents of same sex marriage claim that the primary purpose of marriage is procreation son same sex couples are unable to procreate and their own the opponents argue they don't have a right to bear in the last so to speak to relevant virtue this line of reasoning is that the heart of the case against same sex marriage and justice marshall took it on directly she disputes the claim that procreation is the primary purpose of marriage and she does so by showing that marriage is currently practiced and regulated by the state does not require the utility to procreate heterosexual couples to apply for marriage licenses are not asked about their ability or intention to conceive children fertility is not a condition of marriage people quit never consummated their marriage and never planned to meet the narrator people who can't scare from their death bed may merit so wrote justice marshall to the core and so she concludes its teeth too acidic incriminate commitment of the married artist to one another not to be getting its children to this is seen quinones of civil marriage so hot is the argument worked part of the argument consist of an interpretation of tucker does support essence that marriage as it currently exists another part of the argument is to ask which interpretation of marriage celebrates virtues boris ,comma and what account says the purpose of marriage partly depends on what qualities we think marriage should celebrate enter from this makes the underlying moral and religious controversy unaffordable white is tomorrow's status of daily lesbian relationships marshall is not neutral on this question she argues in a court opinion that same sex relationships are as worthy of respect as heterosexual ones so the case for same sex marriage is not neutral after all he awarded to his side who should qualify for marriage we have to sink to the purpose of marriage and the virtues that honors in this carries test on two contested morrow parade where we can't remain neutral toward competing conceptions of the good life what is all just tell us the attempt to get cash arguments about justice and rightist from arguments about the good life is mistaken for two reasons first it's not always possible to decide questions of justice in right without resulting substantive morrow questions and this is true whether we're arguing about surrogacy or about how to distribute flutes or political authority for the right to use a golf cart or same sex marriage arguments about justice in right sock unavoidably arguments about tomorrow meaning of the goods to state the second reason is that even where it may be possible you may not be desirable and that brings me back to the question of revitalizing our public discourse in democratic life that if his wife argued it's not possible for government to be neutral in its disagreements isn't in the last possible to get knocked out politics on the basis of mutual respect yet serves i think it's yes in recent decades we've come to assume that respecting our fellow citizens moral and religious convictions means ignoring them leading them undisturbed conducting our public life and so far as possible without reference to the the diskettes of employee groups makes for a spurious respect bottling it means suppressing moral disagreement rather than actually avoiding it this intern provoked a backlash and resentment as we see in the rise of religious fundamentalism and more robust public engagement would tomorrow disagreements could provide a stronger nada weaker basis for mutual respect what would have looked like build rather than avoid the moral and religious convictions of our fellow citizens we should attend to the more direct with sometimes by challenging and contesting them sometimes by listening and learning from the is always

my hunch is that the prospect is next to good news of the internet is that it provides the cheap way to communicate the not so good news is that the internet can possibly hope to replaces the raft
