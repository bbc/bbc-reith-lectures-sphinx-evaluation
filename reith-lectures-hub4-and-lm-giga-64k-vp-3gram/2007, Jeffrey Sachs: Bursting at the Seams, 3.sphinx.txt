john f. kennedy summed up his potential when he declared microbes are problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by a man and man can be used because he wants no problem if you and ask the e. u.'s yon human beings man's resent and spirit have often solves all the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do woody dan and of course kennedy was right we stand today in the two hundred ten

material life and ecological sustainability would outlive prove technologies to raise food productivity to use water for fish at least to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of energy there could be no way to combine economic well being and environmental sustainability for any finally their mosque ,comma global agreements implementing treaty such as the un framework convention on climate change digging pension on biological diversity and of course the millennium development goals ironically to many of us on the planet the first three steps scientists public awareness and technological solutions all seen what didn't reach while global agreements on how to respond to seem impossible to get this skepticism it seems it is about our very ability to cooperate on this planet not about the technical solutions corps most challenging problems yet to quote kennedy once again the bullies in the global cooperation is beyond our capacity use quotes a dangerous defeatist belief it leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable that mankind is doomed that we are gripped by forces we cannot control what kennedy spoke large numbers of americans thought the peace with the soviet union was impossible due to wrong so toward no study global lead duke we cannot agree to end poverty fight climate change and even to make peace in the middle east and all its work yet global cooperation needs effective so cold it is a challenge that we have only sporadically to cheat global cooperation and is at risk for three reasons the most for chengdu is the ever present threat and reality of war born of the darker side of human nature a second reason why cooperation fails in his bed in our interconnected world de claps of any single part of the world even at places isolated as afghanistan as the implications for all of the world cooperation unity interconnected world must therefore be comprehensive something our societies still do not appreciate or accept we must care worked and also acts your spy sta suffering in sudan or yemen ordaz hoped or i could get it but there are reasons for failure used sheer complexity are problems are not all of a global scale to world isn't interconnected the unprecedented ways that require unprecedented strategies for cooperation tonight i will focus on the first of these risks the threat of war are greatest threat on the planet remains the threat of massive war our species is drawn to wit like moths to look when we are not more alike by nature that is far too simplistic but we are all our bull tubular baltimore to solve problems kept the trillion dollars lire or rock you might think we would induce abused at the notion that even our hometown press the new york times recently editorialized for a boost indecisive the standing army and a boost to get the military budget this indeed would be a recipe do eat to fail my worry is that we are gambling recklessly with a one to fourteen to match the year nineteen fourteen letter explaining nearly one hundred years ago when nineteen fourteen the piece was so eager to buy the guns of august and the twenty century never quite were covered world war one almost literally came out of nowhere so much so that historians still debate why the war occurred i happy marcher soldiers do we need each nation's honor wheat in a few weeks turned into four years of mass carnage bend the bolshevik revolution the rise of hitler irked the whole cost and more r. warren araki are threats to oran anybody to grow when you can't tight chinese sentiments expressed eke frisa elite in the well of the new west senate all raise the stakes of a similar disaster on our generation's watch we are not due to this outcome but we can do ,comma and the accomplices to where to to deeper aspects of human psychology are crucial here the first to use the humidity is high over between cooperation and conflict we are actually prine psychologically and probably genetically to cooperate but bullied conditionally so in a situation of low fear each of us is prone to cooperate and to share it with a stranger yet when meditrust evaporates into buses primed to revert to conflicts last we are better by the other day purists call this strategy tit for tat according to which we cooperate at the outset but retaliate when cooperation breaks down or risk obviously is an accident in which cooperation collapses and both sides get caught in a trap in which conflict becomes a self fulfilling prophecy in at all too real nice mirror we'd end up fighting because we fear that the other will fly to this fear is different by fear itself and by the outcome wars occurred despite the absence of any deeper causes the second crucial piece of human psychology is that we are social animals with a strong tendency to my dad if i would any group we classify ourselves as new york artist or americans or jew whose or moslems or professors or artists were bankers in most cases we are part of many groups are identities are mauled by faceted and that he gets us to gather it overlapping where is all trust and shared three guard yet admitted he fired it to feed your a single heater group a single costs can subtly takeover world

carnage over weeks put these two pieces to tapered cabs strategy any costs versus baum logic to gather and we can see how the world can fronds alternative futures one possible future is a world which trusted guild's crossed cooperation be gets cooperation are identities remain multiple i need the new yorker irked working :colon the university in partnership with mike colleagues in egypt and jordan would dress problems of water when climb into the middle east that haggar malta by dan to use the road to peace to a century of prosperity twig anniversary of nineteen fourteen that nodes human folly and tragedy rather than human fate be other future haul ever puts us into a world of spiralling conflict box cutters and hijacked planes bring death and disaster new york city we retaliated nowhere rockwood was not party to be attacked and thereby spread the conflict wheel altogether a terrorist group about height of wheat states such as libya and north korea are rockin' around failing to recognize that states are much more complex and would have varied interests that can be the subject of negotiation cooperation collapses it subtly austin versus them howe then integrate this dangerous cycle one is threatening today as it was during the cold war and it is now marked by degrade perils of each are really just hate it and zealotry a wider spread of nuclear weapons and stronger irked global interconnections that amplify a conflict to all corners of the world and ganging we must take kennedy's greatest insight that call peace is a process the way of solving problems let's see how kennedy applied at first ,comma the site and tuesday and learned to do would in our risk kennedy's speech and to ten nineteen sixty three woodshed quoted drop this evening and trout are recollect surest was not only since relating exposition in peace and not only a challenge to his generation to make peace but was also part of the process itself a wheat acropolis solver kennedy let early uses speech to make peace cantonese chosen process was the genius he tie or speeches to his fellow americans not to disobedient he didn't tell the soviets that they were either with us or against us he didn't lay down preconditions for negotiations your word reno threats of sanctions is back the opposite was true the tighter speech was about a new west bay heat here any new west attitudes instead of lecturing the soviets kennedy said and i quote i also believe that we must we examine our own added to a city individuals and as a nation for our attitude is as essential as bearers we should see said quote began by looking inward to the possibilities of peace corps disobedient toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home history records the results khrushchev immediately declared a draw harriman new west diplomatic convoy that the speech was pulled up best statement made by a any president since roosevelt and declared his intention immediately to negotiate a treaty so successful was kennedy and his team led by speech writer ted sorensen was weakest this evening that the speech itself was followed in a mere six weeks by partial nuclear test ban treaty which disobedient and sold on july twenty fifty nineteen sixty three that test ban treaty history shows was the turning point of the cold war that first step down from the threat of imminent mutual destruction that it occurred during the cuban missile crisis a step that put the world on the path of arms control then detente perestroika and the end of the cold war itself cooperation in the ghali cooperation and in the shadow no pub near armageddon of the cuban missile crisis corrects itself fulfilling conflict will ride a speedy years ahead many americans and europeans dole still protected by the dominant military forces in the planet's will be afraid to any increasingly so they will fear the rise of china's economic political pineau terry power the rights of the india the changing

will likely be eclipsed in total economic size by china within a generation don't not per capita income western europe's population which was nearly four times that of the middle east plus north africa in nineteen fifty is now only one third larger and will be an inherited in population by twenty twenty five by the year twenty fifty the population of the middle east and north africa up will be around one third larger than europe's population in the meantime the moslem population in europe will also support perhaps to one third in the major cities both because of the migration and because of higher fertility rates of european muslims compared with european christians this wall is cause for alarm in many quarters that we already see it in the rise of anti emigrant outlook sixty day yet we must not let our anxieties run ahead of last enterprise his control over future feared he gets here but so too can trust begat trust gets it all in the process i speak tonight in a city that is an exemplar of what globalization can offer new york city is about forty percent foreign warned it is a unique amalgam of civilizations manhattan is aboard are hispanic fifteen percent african american ten percent asian and half white and not to spend a heat is indeed a forerunner of the demographics of the new west as a whole by made centuries when the census bureau forecast that the white not a

the illegal population movements to win it tolerable degrees in some or if we proceed with wisdom our generation can cooperate globally hedy use most likely get our varied genes to do so we must seek peace as a process we must understand to defer agility of a peace and how war can escalate we have much to watch the speeds of threats sanctions and preemptive strikes and far too little and examining our own attitudes as kennedy beat us to do it time for a process of building trust which iran with palestine without fork up and with our own poor at home each of us needs to reach out in our multiple identities to make connections to other parts of the world we need to act a bit preconditions to talk we need it aided a the prevailing confusion but claims that negotiating with an adversary is the same as appeasing bat adversary the true lesson of the nineteen thirty eight munich agreement when british prime minister chamberlain exceeded in hitler's assault and chuckles of akio is not to any

the american people is that they are pragmatic we see that while americans largely supported iraq war as a people each misguided is a war is before the war ever commenced americans now see it doesn't work and i think that pragmatism he is certainly our best hope our country has produced great leaders unit pulled the society that do use skills need very open society and we produced leaders that spoke of her charity for all and malice toward snow and and to talk about the only thing we have to fear is that he is fear itself and who told us to locate in a word to make east with our enemies so
