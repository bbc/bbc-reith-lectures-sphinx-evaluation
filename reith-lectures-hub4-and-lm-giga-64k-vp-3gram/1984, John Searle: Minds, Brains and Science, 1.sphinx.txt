this is about cost and the talk i accepted the peace he beat a chance this late in the series and my aim is the brains and signed skiff and bike to own cell was a russian april coast in nineteen eighty full thrust out his own years people have been trying to understand their relishing shipped to the rest of the universe for a variety of reasons many colas russ today are reluctant to tackle such big problems in the west but problems remain at in these lectures i'm going to attack some of them at the moment the biggest problem is this we have a certain commonsense picture of ourselves as human beings which is very hard to square with our overall scientific conception of the physical world we think of ourselves as conscious free mindful rational agents in a world of science tells us consists entirely of mindless meaningless physical particles baca we squarely stu conceptions hoffer example could be both a case that the world contains nothing but unconscious physical particles and yet it also contains consciousness houk intimate can echo universe containing intentionally stakes human beings human beings that can represent the world to themselves how can an essentially meaningless world contain meanings such problems also spill over into other more contemporary sounding issues his show we interpret recent work in computer science and artificial intelligence work aimed at making intelligent machines specifically does the digital computer at last to give us the right picture the human mind and why is it that the social sciences in general have not given as insights into ourselves comparable to those with the natural sciences have given us into the rest of nature in this first lecture i walked up on you right into what many philosophers think of is the hardest problem of all what the relation of our minds to the rest of the universe this i'm sure you'll wreck he now ais is the traditional minded body or mind brain problem its contemporary version it usually takes the form how does the mind relate to the brain i believe that the mine about a problem has a rather simple solutions one that's consistent both with what we know about narrow physiology and with our common sense conception of the nature of our mental states pains beliefs desires and so on that before presenting that solution i want to ask why it is the mine body problems seem so when tractebel whiter we still haven't philosophy and psychology after all these centuries and minded body problem in a way that we do not have state at digestion stomach problem white is the mind seymour mysterious to us that if other biological phenomena are convinced that part of the difficulty is that we persist in talking about a twentieth century problem in and out demoted seventeenth century vocabulary but i was an undergraduate i remember being dissatisfied with the choices that were apparently available in the philosophy of mind you could be either remotest or dullest if you're a modesty that beater immaterial lister and idealist if immaterial as you could be either behaviorist or physical lust and so on why aims in what follows is to try to break out of these tired categories but vocabulary apart as there is still a problem or family of problems since descartes denying about a problem has taken the following four houk awakened to the relationships the tweed to apparently completely different kinds of things and what they and their mental things such as our thoughts and feelings we think of him as subjective conscious and immaterial in the other hand their physical things that we think of them as having mast is extended in space and as cars or interacting with other physical things maoist attempted solutions to the mind body problem lined up by denying the existence of lord in some way downgrading the status of what are the other of these types of things get in the successes of the physical sciences it's not surprising that at our stage of intellectual development the temptation is to downgrade the status of mental entities most of the recently fashionable material list conceptions of the mine's ijaz back hater ism functional asimov physical ism endowed by denying implicitly or explicitly that they are hiring any such things as minds as we ordinarily think of them that is they deny that we really do we intrinsically have subjective conscious mental states that are as real as anything else in the universe now white had a deal that white is it that so many serious end up by denying the intrinsically mental character of mental phenomena if we can answer that question i believe that we will understand why the mind body problem has seemed so intractable for so long therefore features of mental phenomena which have made them seem impossible to fit into marked scientific conception of the world is made up of material things he needs to be used for features that have made the mine body problem really difficult the first and most important of these features his consciousness eye at the moment of saying this and you what a moment of hearing it are both conscience it's just up claimed fact about the world that it contains such conscious mental states of the band's but it's hard to see how mere physical systems could have consciousness how could such a thing occurred house for example could as gray and white block inside my skull beat conscious i think existence of consciousness of what does seem a mason who is consciousness is the central fact of specifically human existence because without it all the other specifically human aspects of our existence ijaz language alone if humor in seoul on would be impossible i believe it is about the way something of a scandal that contemporary discussions in philosophy and psychology have so little of interest to tell us about consciousness that sack indian track double feature of the mind is what philosophers and psychologists call intention now the best feature by which our mental states are directed at port about or refer to or are all objects and state of affairs in the world other than themselves intention audi bad away doesn't just preferred when tensions but also the believes desires hoax fierce love paid less discussed shame pride irritation amusement in all of those mental states whether conscious or unconscious that referred to move or are about to the world apart from the mine now the question about attention audi is much like a question about consciousness how candace stuffed inside my head be ya about anything how can it referred anything after all this stuff and ask all consists of adams and avoid justice all the rest of material reality consists of atoms and avoid how to put it crudely cut adams can avoid represent anything the third feature the mind that seems difficult to accommodate with in a scientific conception of reality is that subjectivity of mental states this subjectivity is marked by such facts as that i can feel my pain and you can't i see the world from my point of view we see it from your point of view i'm aware of myself and my internal mental state is quite distinct from the cells and mental states of other people since the seventeenth century we've come to think of reality as something which must be equally accessible to all competent observers that he is we think it must be objective now how are we to accommodate the reality of sao objective mental phenomena with the scientific conception of reality as totally object if i live as a fourth problem the problem of mental causation we also comes as part of commonsense that our thoughts and feelings make a difference to the way we behave that they actually have some cause or effect on the physical world id site for example to raise my arm and low and behold my arm ghost up but if our thoughts and feelings are truly meant all top gun they affect anything physical are we supposed to think that our thoughts and feelings can somehow produce chemical effects on our brains and the rest of our nervous system do we suppose that the thought of wrap itself around the exxon's at midday and writes or that it can sneak inside the cell wall and attacked the cell nucleus how could such things possibly occur but a less sounds such connection takes place between the mind and a brain and we left with a view that the mine doesn't matter that it is as an important cause the league as the froth on a wave his to the movement of the way he if defrost work conscious you might think to its self laptop job eight years calling these waves up on the beach and then pulling them out again hold bay along that we know that defrost doesn't make any important difference now why don't we suppose our mental life is in a more important that a frost on the wave of physical reality these for features that consciousness intention alley subjectivity and mental causation are what makes them mind body problems seem so difficult yet i wish to say they're for real features of our mental lives not every mental state has all of them but in a satisfactory account of the money at a mine body relations must take account of all four features if your theory ends up by denying any one of them you know you must have made a mistake somewhere the first pieces i want to advance towards seoul thing of the mind body problem is this mental phenomena omen port phenomena whether conscious or unconscious visual or auditory pains tickles speeches thoughts indeed of all of our mental life are caused by processes going on in the brain for example let's consider paints a corps of anything we see now may seem wonderfully quaint in a generation or so is our knowledge of how the brain works increases nonetheless the farm of the explanation can remain ballad even though the details are bolstered in current use pain signals are transmitted from sensory nerve endings to the spinal cord by at least two types of fibers delta eight fibers which are specialized for prickly sense actions and c. fibers which are specialized for burning an aching sensations as the signals go up the spine bait into the brain by two separate pathways that prickly pain pathways and a burning pain pathway both hathaway's go through the ballot this but dupree clean pain pathway is mauro localized afterwards indus amana sensory cortex brezhnev burning pain pathway transmits signals not only upwards into the cortex but also lack trilling and the hype that salim as some other regions at the base of the brain now for the purposes of this discussion that point we need to hammer home his biggest power sensations of paints are caused by a series of events that began at three nerve endings and indian afoul amass and in other regions of the brain indeed as far as the actual sensations are concerned the advance inside the central nervous system are quite sufficient to cause pain just as we know both from the phantom limb pain is felt by amputees and the pains caused by artificially stimulating relevant portions of the brain and a one to suggest that what is true of pena's truest mental phenomenon generally to put it crudely and counting all of the central nervous system as part of a brain for prayers and discussions everything that matters for our mental life all of our thoughts and feelings park caused by processes inside the brain that crucial step is the one that goes on inside their head knock the external or peripheral stimulus and the argument that this is simple if the events outside the central nervous system occurred but nothing happened in the brain that would be nomad laments that if the right thing has happened in the brain that mental events would occur even if there was no outside stimulus if pains and other mental phenomena are caused by processes in the brain one wants fennel well what our paints what are they really in the case of pains the obvious answer is that they are unpleasant sorts of sensations but that answer leads this unsatisfied because it doesn't tell us how pains fit into our overall conception of a world once again i think he answered the question is obvious but will take some spelling out to our first clank and pains and other mental phenomena are caused by brain processes we need depth at a second car came pains and other mental phenomena are features of the brain and perhaps the rest of the central nervous system no one in the primary aims this lecture is to show how both of these propositions can be true together how can it be both a case that brains coy as minds and get my aims jest bar features of brain if mental and physical phenomena have cause and effect relationships how can one be a feature of the other one is that it implied that combined caused its self that dreaded doctrine are paolo sasso we but at the bottom of our puzzlement is a misunderstanding causation it's tempting to think that whenever a causes b. m. must be to discrete events one identified as the core is the other identified as the effect that all causation functions in the same way as billiard balls hitting each other this cruel model of the causal relationships between the brain in amman aimed inclines us to accept some kind of dough as a big events in one material realm the physical cause events in another insubstantial realm the mental but that seems to be a mistake and a waiter or move a mistake is to get a more sophisticated concept of causation to do this i want to turn away from the relationships between mind and brain for a moment to observe some other sorts of cars or relationships in nature are common this station in physics is between micro and macro properties of systems this small and large scales consider free sample the desk at which i'm now sitting with a glass of water in front of me each object is composed of micro particles the micro particles have features that the level of molecules and atoms as well as at a deeper level of subatomic particles that each object also has certain property such as the solidity of the table the liquidity of the water and the transparency of the blast which our surface or global properties of the physical systems many such surface or global properties can be caused only explained by the behavior of elements of the micro level for example the solidity of the table in front of me is explained by the lattice structure occupied by the molecules of which the table is composed similarly to the liquidity of the water is explained by the nature of the interactions between the age duo molecules allied seems to me that these rather but now all examples provide a perfectly ordinary model for explaining the puzzling relationships between the mind of the brain in the case of liquidity solidity and transparency we have no difficulty at all in saying that the surface features are caused by the behavior of elements of the micro level at the same time we accepted this surface phenomena just art features of the systems in question the clearest way i know what skating this point is to say that this circus feature is caused by the behavior of micro elements at the same time is realized in the system that made up of the microbial abuts there he is indeed a cause and effect relationship but at the same time best surface features are just a higher level features of the very system whose behavior at the micro level causes them die in objecting to this one might say that liquidity solidity and so on are really identical with features of the micro structure so free sample we might just define insulated de esta lattice structure of the molecular arrangements with its buoyancy is to make correct but not really an objection to the analysis that are proposing its a characteristic of the progress of science than an expression that originally defined in terms of surface features features accessible to the senses is absolutely defined in terms of the micro structure that causes the surface features does it take the example of solidity that table in front of me as solid in the ordinary sense this region it resists pressure it supports boeck sits not easily penetrate bulb by most other objects such as other tables and so on such is the commonsense notion of solidity and in a scientific bain one can then defines solidity as whatever might grow structure causes these gross observable features one condemns a either did solidity jest is the lattice structure the system of molecules and that solidity so defined clauses for example resistance to touch and pressure or one can say that salinity consists of such higher level things as rigidity and resistance to touch and pressure and is caused by the behavior of elements at the micro level now if we apply these lessons to the study of the minute it seems to me there's no difficulty in accounting for the relations of the mind to the brain in terms of the brain's functioning could cause mental states just as the liquidity of the water is caused by the behavior of elements of the micro level and yet at the same time as a feature realized in the system if micro elements so what exactly that sense of color as buying and realized he had mental phenomena are caused by processes going on in the brain at the moreau are modular level and they are realized in the very system that consists of nor aunts and just as we need a mike groh macro distinction for any physical system for the same reasons we need a micro macro distinction to the brain but we can say of a system of particles that is ten degrees centigrade or solid or liquid we can't say yet edi given particle that this article is solid this article is liquid this article is tender greece had agreed i can't reach into this class pullout a molecule and say this one's went now in exactly the same way as far as we know anything at all about it though we can say about particular brain this brain is conscious or this breed is experiencing thirst or paint we cannot say in any particular naranjo this new oran is in pain this know iran is experiencing thursday to repeat his party though there are enormous empirical mysteries about how the brain works in detail there are no logical or philosophical or metaphysical obstacles to accounting for the relation between the mind of the brain aid in terms are completely familiar to us from the rest of nature what's now return to the four problems that seem to face any attempt to solve the mine brain problem first powell his consciousness possible stop best way to show how something is possible is to show how it actually exists we've already given a sketch of how pains are actually caused by narrow physiological processes going on in the fallow must end this century cortex why is it then that many people feel dissatisfied with this sort of an answer i think that by pursuing an analogy with the earlier problem in the history of science we can dispel this sense of puzzlement for longtime many biologists simple lost first thought it was impossible in principle to account for the existence of life and purely biological grounds they thought to be in addition to the biological processes some other element must be necessary some below the battle must be posture waited in order to live life to what was otherwise just dad and convert matt turk it's hard to date to realize how intense the disputed waters between vital list and make a nest even a generation ago but today these issues are no longer take it seriously why not ice think it's not so much because mechanism wanton vitally some last but because we've come to understand better the biological character of the processes that are characteristic of living organisms once we understand how the features have a biological explanation it no longer seems mysterious to us that matter should be a life that i suggested exactly similar considerations should apply to our discussions of consciousness it should seem no more mysterious in principle that this hunk of master is gray and white boat i meals textured substance of the brain should be conscious that it seems to us mysterious that this other hunk of matter this collection of new clio protein molecules stock ,comma or calcium frame should be allowed if the way ensured to dispel the mystery is to understand the processes we don't yet fully understand oppress s.'s but we do understand their general character we understand that there are certain specific electro cameco activities going on among neurons or maran modules impressed other features of the brain and that these processes caused consciousness are second problem houk and adams and avoid having intention audi how can they beat up bought something as what our first question the best way to show how something as possible ways to show how it actually exists considered first as far as we know anything about it at least certain kinds of firstar caused at the height of salomon's by sequences and or firings these firings are in turn caused by the actions of kangyo tents and and hype without most an angelic tents and in turn is synthesized by iran and which is secreted by the kidneys thirst at least of these kinds is caused by a series of events in the central nervous system principally the hype of salomon's and is realized in the hype that talent is not to be thirsty used to have among other things the desire to drink thursday is therefore any intentional state it has content its content determines under what conditions it satisfied that it has all the rest of the features that are common to intentional states as with the mysteries of life and consciousness the way m. master the mystery of intention audi is to describe it as much detail as we can howl of phenomena are caused by biological processes well being of the same time are realized in biological systems visual and auditory experiences tactile sensations hunger or thirst and sexual desire are all caused by brain processes had realized in the structure of the brain and they are all intentional phenomena third paddle we accommodate this subjectivity of mental states within an object that conception of the real world it seems to me emmis gate to suppose that the definition of reality should exclude subjectivity if this scientific account of the world attempts to describe how things are that one of the features of the account will be the subjectivity of mental states said it is just a plain fact about biological evolution that it has produced certain sorts of biological systems namely human and certain animal brains that have subjected features might present state of consciousness is a feature of my brain but its conscious aspects are accessible to me in a way that they're not accessible to you and your present state of consciousness is a feature of your brain and its conscious aspects are excessive book to you in a way that they are not accessible to me that the existence of subjectivity is an object effect of biology it's a persistent mistake to try to define science in terms of certain features of existing scientific theories but wants this provincialism is perceived to be the prejudice india's then in the domain of facts is a subject of systematic investigation if for example god existed then that fact would be a fact like any other i don't know whether god exists but i have no doubt at all that subjective mental states exist because i'm now when i won and seoul or you if a fact of subjectivity runs counter to a certain definition of the words science benes that definition and not the fact that i we will have to abandon fourth dump robb on a metal causation struck present purpose is to explain how mental events can cause physical events ,comma for example could anything as weak less as gaseous has a theory of as a thought give rise to an action well the answer is that thoughts are not await less gaseous and ethereal when you ever thought brain activity is actually going on brain activity causes bodily movements by physiological processes now because the mental states are features of the brain they have two levels of description a higher level and mental terms at a lower level and physiological terms the very same causal powers of the system can be described at either level once again we can use an analogy from physics to illustrate these relationships consider hammering and nail with a hammer both hammer and may all have a certain kind of solidity hammers made of cotton waller bought or will be quite useless and hammers made of water or steam arnott hammers at all solidity is a real causal property of the hammer butkus solidity itself is caused by the behavior of particles at the micro level and is realized in this system of micro elements the existence of two cars only real levels of description in the brain is exactly analogous to the existence of two cars only real levels of descriptions of a hammer consciousness for example is the real property in the brain that can cause things to happen mike conscious attempt to perform an action such as raising my arm causes the movement of the armed at the higher level of description the intention to raise my arm causes the movement of the armed at the lower level of description a series of nor on firing starts a chain of events that results in a contraction of the muscles as with a case of hammering and they all the same sequence of events has two levels of description both of them are clause only real and a higher level causal features are both caused by and realize the end the structure of the lower level elements to summarize in my view the mind of a body interact but they're not too different things since met both phenomena are features of the brain one way to characterize this solution to the mine body problem is to see it as an assertion of both physical and some can't mantle isn't suppose we define it naive physical ism to be the view that all that exists in the world are physical particles with their properties in relations took power in the physical model of reality is so great that it's hard to see how we can seriously challenge ninety physical as a canal and define naive mental ism to be the view that metal phenomena are really exist there really are mental state some of them are caught as many had been tension audi they all have subjectivity and many of them function caused a late in determining physical events in the world that these esso this first reflex or can now be stated quite simply naive medco winsome and naive physical issam are perfectly consistent with each other indeed as far as we know anything about how the world works there not only consistent there both true and listening to putt cost and the talk i said the b. b. c. beat a chance to mold caught tossed keys that fit the b. c. don't tend to hurt t. k. /slash t. is full
