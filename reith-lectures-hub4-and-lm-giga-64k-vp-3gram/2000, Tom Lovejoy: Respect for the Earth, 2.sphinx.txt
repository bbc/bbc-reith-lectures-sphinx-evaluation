to rescind their ideas in their inspection area is the challenge that is he as the selection is and indeed sulk or depressed is how can we make sustainable development hopp and can we keep the weld safe croc children's children in auditing nectar las became undone democracy was the theme is given by the beating petition and european commission up chris patten this week we tend to an eminent scientist in the field ,comma speed up joining chief buyer divest the advice of the well in bank accounts that at the smithsonian institution in washington he was in his quest to end that he is the town of biodiversity some twenty yes again and indeed that is the topic of his neck to today a couple of weeks ago he was in the thomas and his heeding his is said to be trying to conduct key american officials to the importance of conservation the rain forest he says makes the best costume nowotny of critics to have him here with passing a centerpiece at pace he specially to use as he explained this to be new to his victim swede invited a distinguished leans to the huntington hideous evening but not just the son to have the cellist make their views in cash and to challenge a lecture at the turn at a grand but now when you let a lot we trapped thomas eat up chilling hack and so pleased that this evening we have with us that icon of american conservation the arch druid himself david brower thank you so much of the act from the moment of our birth we grow up in a world of difference very early we learned we share this world's not just with our family but with other living things every child has its buck .period pensacola or biologist e. o. wilson sets we discovered that not only are there different kinds of plants are mammals which side is calls theses but also upped that there can be lots of difference between individuals of any one time this genetic variation rediscover first and our parents and unless we live in an urban setting far from a park we soon learned that different kinds of animals and plants live together in different places camels in deserts whales in the seas guerrillas in tropical forests that totality of this diversity from the genetic level through organ is a use to heat his isms of landscapes is termed collective weight biological diversity but chose to come to california to give this lecture rather than somewhere else because of an exciting experiment with biological diversity i believe it may well help us in the global quest to maintain the biological underpinnings of sustainability but i will turn to this story of the california madcap shirt later in the stock is another fact of life that no organism can exist without affecting its environment to be alive requires energy so all organisms need the even green plants which use the energy of the sun after taken nutrients to both live and grow up similarly paul organisms produce twice while arum biodegradable and ended is nothing short of astonishing what some organisms will feed upon the waste to alter the environment and potentially affects other organisms consequently the choice confronting humanity is not whether it affects the environment word is not rather the choices adapt power we affect the informant that is in what way is and to what extent our planet is very much a living planet and its incredibly rich web of life is central to how it functions and therefore to sustainability of the human enterprise understand and attaining sustainability is therefore very complex and this not a net of many examples solutions at the moment it is clear that we are far far from sustainability we are in deep trouble biologically and already into a spasm of extinction a work in making unequaled since the one which took the dinosaurs that is not the peaceable kingdom the rate at which species disappeared as a bad one thousand to ten thousand times normal and a quarter or more of hall's feces could vanish when in a couple of decades there is a major problem with biological diversity that really isn't given what is far more importance is to recognize what is happening and how we might arrange their lives so our grandchildren can enjoy a sustainable existence on a biologically rich planet biological diversity and wiest have a heart of sustainable goodall and the quality of our allies and twenty with it so much more deeply than most of us ever notice that our fate depends on how well we provide for the future of all other forms of life this does is way beyond the obvious and essentials of food and fiber and sheltered to medicines and complex industrial processes biological diversity is essentially an incredibly fast to library for the life sciences which is drawn upon to improve critical biologically based enterprises like agriculture and medicine just recently the sample from a zambia's he riverbank of an obscure group of organisms called slime molds yielded a promising new comcast to fight tumors resistant to tax all taxol that key element in the arsenal against breast or ovarian and one cancer loses effectiveness in some cases taxol itself or ritual aimed came from the pacific fuel considered by forrester is just a few years ago to be a trash tree in the forests at the northwest united states the effective molecules in both cases came from natural defenses of the two wilds feces in interactions with other species sometimes the lake is lester wrapped but nonetheless very real ass for example the development of the ace inhibitors for treating high blood pressure which are rose from the discovery of cannon and system of regulation of blood pressure in the chorus of the study of the denim of a tropical viper the structure and aegis systems is made up of diverse kinds of plants and animals and microorganisms and their combined metabolism is constitute ecosystem function in this day of quick resort to technological fixes it is no hope the new york city elected to restore the ecosystem function of its degrading warder shed rather than constructs the water treatment plant where i grew up in that city who was famous for the quality of its water when i would return after being away our member noticing how delicious the water tasted idiot and a one and one chasing it's over fancied european bottled waters saturday but changes in land use and a water shed lets you deteriorating water quality and tell our environmental protection agency was about to require the city to build a multibillion dollar water treatment facility instead abid issue at a tenth the cost made it possible to restore the watershed its biological diversity and therefore its functions there was a natural can a permanent solution what we often call natural disasters are not always match for they often happened where little recognized ecosystem services namely that a disaster for pension has broken down the horrifying floods and mudslides hurricane mention brought honduras and the even more ghastly events in december following heavy rains in venezuela demonstrate this twelve equally heavy rains in venezuela in nineteen fifty two had much lesser consequences because the pork the allston and victims had not defended the forested critical slopes in honduras there aren't anecdotes of adjacent hillsides in which the one with intact forests remain stable and also released west floodwater often characterized as natural disasters these are only partly so and the devastating humanitarian and economic woes make a strong argument for maintenance of ecosystems and their services and right now we're so then this happened once again in madagascar about fifty years ago american freshwater ecologists with patrick began in a line of research subsequently recognized by the us national medal of science risk has essentially been den mother for a couple of generations of scientists that is in my personal pantheon fifteen years ago when i chose her to speak at a particularly important meeting on the environment someone ask me why did you choose someone so all my replied when your grandmother tells you you have to use their headlights to take a more serious when out with hat trick again a systematic study of rivers and their biological diversity which demonstrates that the number is ten kinds of species in a river its biological diversity in our current parlance reflex that basic ecology of the river and the environmental stresses to which it is subject in other words biological diversity integrates the effects of all environmental problems perfecting an ecosystem this is essentially the fundamental does often unrecognized principal in winter all environmental science and management dispensed it applies everywhere not just in freshwater taken at the level of the entire globe the ruth patrick principal means of biological diversity can be considered a single measure of how humanity it is affecting the environment think and act instead of contemplating the welter of impacts society is generating we now can measure the som in a single number a real measurable teak to achieving and recognizing its sustainability at this scale culminate this system such as south florida because seoul's sage scrub of southern california's five cadres or even as ambitious or one as the amazon basin to key consists of maintaining two helmets measure more elements that are characteristic of the particular ditka's system one is the main ensign ecosystem functions such as the sheet flow of water in south florida and the other is maintenance of a biological diversity of the ecosystem that latter can be thought of as managing so that the species lists a hundred or five hundred years from now will be pretty much the same as it is today it's certainly does not mean that this has to be true of every spot with an ecosystem although they do need to be areas of strict preservation there's certainly can relocations cities for example where there is very intense use hello biological diversity that doesn't mean enough while places and off connections between them so all the species can make it in the long term these two measurable goals provide an operational definition for sustainable development with in that piece of geography this of course seriously chow alan jane because it means taking on all environmental problems intrinsic to the area as well as those like dasa grand and climate change which are like strands that while this might seem to ignore the social and economic elements of sustainability in the end it certainly does not opt because otherwise those elements will begin to affect the two measurable standards ecosystem function and biological diversity consequently the other aspects of this lecture series for example goodell one ends and health are also vital for success is not a poetic too late and a history of confined all degradation this ecosystem management approach allows for considerable flexibility and creativity in addressing human aspirations south florida provides an instructive case to march ecological unit that extends from the kissimmee river and lake that each of the tibet halfway up the florida peninsula up down through the everglades parking and includes florida day the florida keys and the coral reef beyond it is essentially a single system depended upon the sheet flow water from north to south known as the river of grass over a half century or more individual isolated decisions each presumably do reasonable in their own context and time for flood control water supply and agricultural purposes have drastically altered outflow not a drop of water flows naturally without a valve being turned in only a quarter to read half of the natural flow reaches florida day depending on the year subterranean flow through the lines and underpinnings as so reduced that fresh water pump welling stunned florida day have ceased their results is a degrading ecosystem reproductive failure where birds in dangers feces hyper salinity in florida day loss of sea grass beds alcove looms and additional stresses on an already stressed racism ecosystem function and file onto older cities are measurably in the air i had no inkling of this when i first visited the everglades as a teenager when apollo swim up so blatantly obvious at that point in nineteen ninety three however when i served as science adviser for the department of the interior the problems were so obvious that i can take cabs some of them on satellite images of the peninsula if the above is a consequence of ad hoc and uncoordinated decision making that the resolution of such problems or better yet their avoidance depends on the converse on integrated content so that this decision making that integrates society's decisions within the aegis system framework when works best that takes the decision making back to where people live this is the essence of the multibillion dollar program to restore it to natural clowning of south florida as much as possible you will take decades and makes a good case for avoiding such problems to begin with that also over this not easy with so many players with differing vested interests for example the state recently refused to implement part of the planned namely to by people who had encroached on some sensitive areas scientifically the plan still needs some significant improvement nonetheless the degradation is beginning to be reversed and the overall trend seems positive southern california where we are tonight presents a different example ,comma to los angeles sent a note and some of the worst urban or suburban sprawl and the united states its native habitat in the coverage is to the point that america's most powerful environmental legislation the endangered species act was invoked on behalf of a jaunty little bird that california nat catcher which just happens to inhabit some of the priciest real estate in the nation the paris of the endangered species act has tended to be used only wants the season is listed an indication that its habitat and constituent biological diversity was on the verge of being endangered itself so the exercise was not just adapted that catcher but an array of other species like the tiny car borrell salamander a lizard known as the orange threaded with tail end this dandy ago thorn meant southern california and facts has a concentration pospisil said found nowhere else you are all living in this biodiversity hot spots if nothing is done and tell us the season reaches the brink of endangerment inevitably there are economic interests squared off against its bases with an obscure in an said even though this really is a signal that the region is beginning to unravel biologically this situation is easily caricature as people versus biological esoteric a famous example is the talented then tennessee versus the little men hope called the snail turner so when i was that the department of the interior the situation here was turning into a classic test case for trying a new approach came out to california and thanks to colleagues at the department of natural resources i have the chance to see this situation firsthand from beer on the grand am with the people seeking a resolution this time the state of california together with the federal agencies and the five county governments undertook to deal with the problem proactive when while it is still some flexibility biologically and legally industry and civil society especially the nature conservancy were active participants in the act was to plant conservation of inch higher natural communities before it was so late that costs and consequences became impossibly high margin landowners such as the irvine company were major players agreed to when exchanges which worked for both nature and their business interests at camp pendleton and stand a good heading the united states marine corps worried that the military might have to show their paper to cure a heavy burden were delighted to discover that when everyone engaged in the plan this was nonstop the commandant even took particular pride in beach management to stay for a nesting sea bird through the regional program some four hundred thousand acres have been identified for eventual protection in network of conservation which is now more than sixty percent complete true endangers theses listing of the net catcher in one sense drove the prospects but there is all was considerably better than otherwise would have been the case using regulatory paris of the endangered species act allowed just two weeks ago california voters approved a four billion dollar bond issue for securing critical conservation land with a lease to hunt in fifty million and this dedicated to southern california identity amazon with such frequency but i've given up explaining it to say i'm always on my way to the amazon and fax everett this lecture on my laptop when i was last there as important as it is from a conservation portage do i confess i also just like to go to this place perpetual biological surprised analysts and the howler monkeys can other jungle noises from a hammock as complex as south florida are southern california are in even more complex challenge is presented by u. s. is a management of the amazon comprising eight nations vernon from the amazon is a major priority in nonetheless operates ecologically as a single system in an extraordinary interaction the tweed biological and physical elements pianos and literally generates half of its and rainfall hit too much forests is cleared in the wrong places the hydraulic g. would begin to change that affect the biology of this the largest of the world's forests the largest wilderness and the world single greatest depository of biological diversity in its vast river system which contains twenty percent of all the river water in the world's resigned at around three thousand species of fish more than the entire north atlantic and some of them even migrate from s. jury to headquarters and back in the course of their white students each amazonian nation fights is hard enough to integrate the various elements of a government decision making into a comprehensive policy resembling something like ecosystem management for their piece of the amazon is there any possibility there could be coordination at the level of the amazon as a home the optimistic answers is that there is certainly a greater chance to dent with some enlightened national leaders and ministers the treaty for amazon cooperation provides the possible framework but it will require leadership specially by brazil which holds two thirds of the real estate and will leave it could happen and i know that multilateral agencies like the world bank the interamerican development bank deal and the p. n. un eighty cost civil society would jump at the chance to support such an effort to stay doubled and allen and takes good governance as well as cuts finds all three of these examples really must be considered works in progress not fine the solutions because environmental problems arise continuously like dragon's teeth when the most important text ends that factors for ecosystem management is that if climate change this is in a large degree because when biological diversity is protected by high slit at parks and reserves the ability of species to move and attract require an ecological conditions is impeded by an obstacle course of human dominated landscapes all will be for hot if society fails to address the greenhouse gas problem the threat is also much more imminent than most people realize the world's is literally melted tropical glaciers will be gone in twenty years and it's a debt on the arctic ice cap indicate that it too is likely to break up in the same time .period wickedness is that there are things we can do that better right now some involve energy substitution and conservation others involved in trees and forests because they play an enormous role in the global carbon cycle and a major effort to stem the first asian re forests and to protect natural forests will ward off further greenhouse gas emissions and also make a major contribution to conservation of biological diversity the moment is enhanced to take the right steps to underpin a sustainable future biologically certainly the challenge is highly complex that most were well italy everywhere so that all adds up to sustainable development yet could be summed up by saying we need to live with in nature rather than think of it has something which is taking care of almost since his confession was fenced off areas while humanity operates without restraint in the rest of the landscape as powerful an imperative as i believe the practical arguments for conservation are eight change in perception and value it at our place in nature that is chief vastly more classical conservation is not can fast enough on airing the patrick principle through ecosystem management means we have to live in a way is the one to grade the biology of areas of strict preservation but also want a grid that humble landscapes in which we live that is why sustainable development is on pouring is also why it is so complex to grasp fortune away in biological diversity we not only have wonderful resources we also have a theory of real measure of sustainability plan frequently or mine didn't have a long discussion with british naturalist gerald jerome when he turned to me with tears in a sarasin said there is so little time the natural world in which we live is nothing short of intransigence it is a wondrous really pursuing high takes great joy and sharing a world with the show wearing a variety of life on earth nor can i believe any of us grilling walk the planet which is a long way way sparked pack act tank to tone up during allied like to open the discussion to the toll could have the task is to tease in coral beds and a family physician and a leader of the southern california's sierra club and career of overseas listeners this your club is the largest volunteer activists in burma organization and united states and will we found is that sustainable development has become a buzzword for humans centered destruction of the wild planet any music instead of sustainable development is something that send acted in its four human sits to diminish air pollution and didn't have good drinking water except for a high wooden question whether or not it may be more reasonable than lee ,comma environmental activists point of view to look at it from the animals in the plant's pointed view rather than the humans born view well and you know what the contract that is precisely why apricot and the conclusion that you really need to have a biological measure as to whether a piece of landscape is being treated at an unsustainable fashion because otherwise there's no real way to know what you actually passer minutes not so in the in many senses addresses grind entirely to your point of view makes this movie's hedonistic rivera cancelling talks director of research at the last ten to two and also theses quit here for the drill which is why the most in danger primates and cotton that africa mine out surveys has again in the nets when the people are told they can't continue to move pursue their livelihood is a lot of resistance for example eons into california and the tire salamander insisted that appeared in danger and the farmers there are having told can tell the same soil that he did before in nigeria beat drill is so endangered that the vocal villagers and being told they can adversely anything to get into the chills don't want to get that immediate reward its in trade for some potential problems in the future being alleviated a handgun tactic in the future they may not be around to the neon and the direct cost to prop up select hastily is happily make the key share more important to today's population while the question is just the basic heart of everything in that environment and a number of other issues is well on the short term versus the long term and i think it's easier to do it if you have a larger framework so if you're looking at its situation among larger piece of landscape which can provide other opportunities which are not structural biology that it's easier to come to some kind of resolution in this sense you are telling somebody they can do something which are also giving them something else they can do and all those is fine and dandy admitted that in the end it also comes down to the total number of people in a piece of landscape and know what the impact is per individual and that various gray way around the world from huge impact on north american skies suppose some people in the third world stopped it is the major challenge that question and josh moved into number professor over cues to elaine and charmers in formosa sightings of an international hunt in your lecture trumbo we've asked our contract and a team that we exist and the reality is a vast divided between those who gain the benefits of environmental conditions and those who pay the costs to the vast majority sought liked to challenge against this notion about diversity because it tends to completely obliterated with finger much worse central issues running garment and that is whose determining what this time of sustainable development of the who's paying for it to news that the costs of the law might answer to that is the fact the first to the three examples like taunted and adding the only reason they're working at all this because there is local participation mellon was said to sticky when it exploded part of the reason it works is that when you have local involvement somebody hasn't pieces the mosaic and gives up a little bit of his or her god didn't write to what it wanted to go in that piece of the mosaic and fax gains much more funding into new occasion with the surrounding pieces of the most and hand and in warding off things that might affect their peace for the sooners won local participation setting again this is a record purse rowdy heidi area representative here you're invited to the world bank not an organization that has too much accountability to the public found in general or to people in local areas and unos applies to them that most of their project's environmental about selling environmental technology hoping for strong corporations don't promote technology it's not about solving structurally environmental problems and wide degradation half its so he provides the love and nice technocratic problem and have a great solution might feel or is it that doing a mild diversity as the measure your maintaining in essence a technocratic talked on the probes will understand that you personally view individual participation communities is important for me to the longino and and is always a tension between the top down in the local potato off a lot of environmental movement starts locally because of some local problem so on and think it's quite so simplistic that says that did come here to defend the world bank formally spending two years on but there is a lot that goes on in the world bank is a lot better than i thought it was a time they were elated at the bank is largely defined by its mistakes and parmesan is to find that there's a portfolio to use the backward on a well in excess of two billion dollars in projects that legitimately be called biological diversity projects come home and that other stuff that gets labeled bothered cons of things which is different from selling infernal technology the heat had made a mistake and a professor from fireman wednesday science at cal tech and i applied to several ,comma and it made about the need to reduce the impact of members of developed countries and their proportional impact compared to less not countries and i just wonder how hostile as the net beyond the really hard and the staff is close to our car like cars and a steady gutted indicated the price of gasoline nice days of hefty for five dollars a gallon before people made serious decisions about fuel economy and how much they would drive and whether it was really important is plenty to levy a color not on gas prices have come close to two dollars a gallon in a southern california and people are in a march on washington put it past likud sunday's hard issues in it like to have a air canada and not how it can approach that well when a stiffer zorro and it is important to have some way to do with energy prices not having stability does going up and down like that slowed but that's very destructive continental won in five we should be using gas point des shouldn't cannot think it's a real sign of hope that the ford motor company on a few weeks back pulled out of the the so called global climate coalition which is all the fossil fuel industries trying to cook who the idea of of climate change from greenhouse gases so there may be some things we have to give up their also may be some things would really creative technology can give this much more acceptable solutions for what hydrogen fuel cells gentleman to back and terrence mcnally if you could stand in the future twenty or twenty five years and ask yourself from acquisition did humanity turn it around you come down on the yes or no any chicken galant e. s. what are some of the firm advantage when looking back what are some of the danes that turned us around i think what's gonna happen to some laypeople are hooded and maybe navy's through this sense of global community is gonna help us flopped and that the millennium celebration was the first time a high ever fell there was something that was truly global and of people start looking at it that way in them to look up there and see the ice cap melting and say if it's time to do something only to have one of these relatively revolutionary moment to play with the ballot box that would suddenly changed the way things happened and without pinkish borrowed hints here at the huntington i preach to teammate /slash the panic will go up in things you do the deal a blow would insult the intimate and thank you to be a trip to a list of joint pat next week to be connected comes and it brought an end to it is the john brown chief executive of b. p. ,comma can he be exploring what should drive the business to preach to sustainable development enough to be in california did not pat you'd be dusting to uphold culled from below a cali so
