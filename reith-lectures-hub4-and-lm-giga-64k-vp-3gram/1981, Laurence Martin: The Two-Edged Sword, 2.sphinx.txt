this is a taut cussed and all kinds of the b. b. c. to take tests this section is to stick to a source to combine aren't smart and as a pigeon it'll cost in nineteen eighty one are not in my first lecture that the centerpiece of the contemporary strategic seemed is something called new kidded terrence many who find this doctrine alarming draw comfort from list to get arms limitation talks in the so called assault agreement that resulted in mustard seed a bit of a shock however if they ever read the best known account to the first soap talks written by mr. john newhouse the former official in united states parse control agency mr. newhouse degraded mara doctor kissinger and his achievement of a sultry de suggests that the underlying principle of the exercise waugh's killing people is good killing weapons is back this judgment and expressed is deadly serious and that the true meaning of that phrase it moderate somewhat once it is he hasn't for purses of arms control that seeks to perpetuate said assist course mr. knew harris doesn't really mean that killing people is good he means that threatening to kill him as good because he believes that such a threat who did turn nuclear attack on anyone with an obvious capacity to retaliate what you think that a weapons is back because they might be the very weapons needed to kill the people and the destruction might thereby condom minded terrence the idea of neutral mass killing is he hopes it unthinkable attacking weapons is not unthinkable and by opening up the idea of new terror attacks that are not immediately and i did a catastrophic it folds into the category of what are often labeled war fighting strategy because the strategy suggests ways of actually using nuclear weapons they allow many people who condemn the very idea has making the world safe for nuclear war furrow let not many people can feel very happy about as the alternative based on the idea that killing people is good this is perhaps the classic notion of nuclear deterrence returned briefly discussed my first nectar when before the caches of japan were cold dick earliest thinkers about nuclear war to johnny idea that if there was no infected defense against nuclear attack if you didn't wish to base your security on lock or on the forbearance of potential enemies you had to rely on the threat of retaliation in kind fatal flaw in terms of what came to be called city basked widest russo is uncertain perhaps it was instinctively felt country to lots of evidence that does nothing government's cherish more than a people perhaps it was a consequence of most long range bombing having bean of the indiscriminate city busting kind in the recently ended a war simply because our inability to do any better at a time when nasa a fifth of r. f. palms fell within five maas of the tour de either with atomic weapons the scarcity of bombs with imitations of aircraft and the erroneous e. predicted inaccuracy of batista miss house only made it reasonable to suspect that in a future war would not be much choice about what to use as a target that was certainly no serious psycho political analysis of what it takes to deter the prosecutor terrence s.'s approach to don kitsch colluded to bind us to do half as as there is only a finite number of cities that the case that which is very well not destroying them maybe supposed to require only a finite number of new director is full nuclear powers would agree only to shoot its cities to would be no need to multiplied and refined long range due to weapons rational governments would thus have no incentive either to launch a nuclear attack or to start is so court are traits so convinced of the efficacy of the strategy worked in steel arts architects that they both in cars to sell the unit were adopted henke and then did us stern measures that might impede distill it capacity to destroy western cities that their ability for a short distraction would be mutual producing did uptrend now known to friends and foes alike in the ironic akron him matt mutual assured destruction this doctrine heller has several increasingly apparent slowest in the first place a doctrine of mere trudy terrence committed in this way requires nations to lift the rest is history with their survival entirely dependent on the good sense and restraint in their opposite numbers such as system seems unlikely to be one conducive to relaxed international environment this sudden change in government and i expected a severe crisis may overturn all expectations reached an invented nations will shortly be continued attempted to search for technical board doctrinal waste of reasserting greater control over their fate in fact somerset twister already being discovered the boost of defenses against ballistic

purely technical means now that the destructive power of the captain has been unleashed a felony because destruction seems to be inherently easier than creation that outlet with a box of matches in a bid to knock could raise versailles but a combination of technique and doctrine is opening up a variety of it is conceivable defensive strategies it pointed out i did my first lecture this summer did karen postures in dupree nuclear powers to deadbeat undermined by the aggressors conviction that the head of product ever planned to avoid the full consequences of his aggression in recent years technological advice is have offered it eased again erupt plans to avoid the full force of nuclear retaliation yet to cut rock set strategies by agreeing not to exploit the technology is in question was one of the primary purpose is all the soap negotiations many people hope that the willingness of the soviet union to enter the sole person is a drug sapped the treaty banning ballistic missile defense proved that the russians endorsed the idea of strategic stability based on mutual assured destruction it now seems much more likely however that the soviet union gave up ballistic missile defense because it's in a system was proving disappointing and united states appeared to be on the first of a more promising breakthrough that has never been much reason to believe that the soviet union like the idea of its own vulnerability that goes against whole grain of historic soviet batista say russian combined with bolshevik philosophy afar and antisense policy to lay their homeland open to enemies underlie merely on duffel berets nor indeed in the nuclear age at the soviet union showed any intonation to regard population as a preferred targets or duke you wore as a mere spasm of neutral annihilation true once mr. khrushchev had broken the intellectual legacy starling the russians are said to be admitted that nuclear war might need to the destruction of the leading socialist state and the war to integrate powers should therefore no longer be regarded as a necessary step in the extension of socialist new q. warships that may be avoided this job is spokesman of always made it plain that should nuclear war ,comma is so weak union would await did so as to minimize damage to themselves so as to prevail and insure the survival of as much as possible of the soviet centers of power the point is well put in an article by mr david holloway and expert on the seven union and is a dead heat by far the baby's contributor in my view to mr. t. p. thompson's well known boeck protests can survive as best holloway puts us to read out a gifted terrance is not seen as foolproof it makes sense to pay attention to how a nuclear war would be fraught and how the sublime to the state could best be assured in the event of such a war in this context victory retains significant is a concept he said a. d. b. striven for if war breaks out some experts who have noted this perverse soviet refusal to stop thanking about what would happen if a nuclear war actually broke out after such a discovery in ways that the car is the impression that dickey amongst those who don't read beyond titles for the soviet union might think it worthwhile to start a large scale nuclear war deliberately in order to crush the west perhaps the best known of these writings was the article by professor richard pipes of harvard entitled why'd the soviet union thinks he could fight and win a nuclear war the significance of this piece isn't hounds for some by the fact that professor pipes is now a member of president reagan's national security stopped the car just idea such writings makes it clear that the sar beginning his extremely anxious to avoid a nuclear war and said they not working tour to talk the day when it will be don't what is also clear however is it's a good strategist ,comma like many western exponents of the tents refused to regard the outbreak of new pier or as an impenetrable fail beyond which fulton planning should call picture rather they regard nuclear war is a highly dangerous possibility which might nevertheless brokered should it happen they think it worth preparing to do better bronson worse games that eventuality distill beginning has therefore provided itself with the fall of are rare but back to a weapons and everest aghast the bees are in any sense unusable it seems clear that the russians would be loath to endorse mr. new hatch's aphorism that killing people is good indeed before it became convenient for the soviet union to sign the treaty banning ballistic missile defenses the then soviet premier mr. conceded delivered some explicit and telling condemnations of the alleged american proclivity for plenty to cure people while the soviet union concentrated on defending the current sharp debate about the future of western nuclear strategy could not and fairly be described as a struggle over whether to persist in trying to educate their rations to the bridge is a rush or destruction or to learn from them instead and adopt a more traditional concept for nuclear strategy one reason for concern is of course the fear that if the soviet union has a conception of how to fight a nuclear war to some out ,comma come the colt prevailing well we only think of it as the end of the world the soviet union may have a decided bargaining a blockage in extreme crisis the possibility that the soviet union has acquired the ability to eliminate the american mad base missile force is so as to meet the weakened united states would know recounted treat options that would be better than surrender that possibility is merely the immediate form of a more general anxiety there is however another reason for misgivings about an american strategy of assured destruction or reasoning goes back to another of the slowest in the original doctrine pocket terrence that identified last time the early architects of the parents seem to have been so preoccupied that staving off a massive nuclear attack that they gave radical thought to why it might occur otherwise they would be accorded to recall that ,comma forces of traditionally being maintained not merely to stave off threats to the very existence of the state but also for protecting a variety of lesser interest and exerting political pressure pop artists the pure doctrine appeared a bit terrence by neutral assured the stocks implies a set of stale makes an effective paralysis of nuclear forces as original reason drive disobey the cessation of political conflict that consequence is as i said last week under the state will continue to use the more familiar forms admitted the power under down brett out of a new pier paralysis or the paralysis will not be complete in states would invent perhaps just don't go on ways to use nuclear weapons to pursue political conflict much postwar strategic debate has been in essence an exploration of these two possibilities the unnaturally possibilities of the greatest possible interest to nature witches come to rely on united states initiating the use of nuclear weapons if the terence fails in conventional defenses collapsed so long as the united states enjoyed a bridge or nuclear monopoly was possible to invoke a threat to pull out nuclear war took hold massive retaliation even for contingencies that did not threaten the security of the united states itself is with the idea summed up the one my favorite phrases from the mouth of the late chief in the air stops to john stats or the dog that we keep to take care of the kept can also take care of the key i. calgene faculty that many western states but never thought it was that simple but undoubtedly the general sense of superiority made it easier to live with the theoretical needs to strike first weiser was clear that that kept the the soviet union was rearing was going to be a tiger beat is the appeal went out of the metaphor in a crisis the united states might now face the dynamic characterized by president kennedy as pollock course or humiliation and eat your search for a series of limited war began what led to the build up a conventional foresees for a flexible response in europe which may disturb the spasms another theory that the fashion for counterinsurgency and by way of that to the fiasco and did not or would like to look at some of the degree of those two series in my next to electric but already in the sixties it was thought of using the large intercontinental weapons intimate ways in famous address is a secret one to his nato colleagues in athens in a public one at the university of michigan in nineteen sixty two president kennedy's secretary of defense robert mac tamara expounded a doctrine of controlled response going off the soviet missiles mosque bearing soviet cities as hostage easy games so that retaliation on the american population back numb artists should abandon decide to have been turned to assure distraction partly because it was proving a practicable to knock out the growing soviet missile force with the technology unavailable but more because he feared the american arms service is we have excuse truck upward spiral of expenditure in the last few years you'll ever the idea of them aged nuke year orders with record limited nuclear options has come to the forefront of debate again this debate is significant not merely foursome and needed the pressing problems of the western alliance but also to the longer term future of strategic theory that just a sudden muster reawaken the debate on an island state of the scale of soviet youth here ,comma and dramatizing authenticated as it were in this old negotiations in the recent dramatic refinement out new kid in the three suspects but gass said he recalled a case for making cities the prime targets rested in large part on the inability to get anything else in reality the american and native of british armed forces always had a set

in the weapons meant that the difference was apparent rosalyn rio very large numbers of soviet citizens would be killed and dismissed except its and varied are the welcome feature of the plan to date the accuracy of miss house opens the possibility of much more disk irma making its tax is therefore possible to conceive theoretically of an attack on a few soviet targets to fish in a limited to leave the soviet union overwhelming incentive not to respond by initiating the sticky busting or bits of fish in a bad able to make the busiest for instance from a successful invasion of western europe has riddled the tara strategies to preferred purpose of such a plan would not be to execute its thereby letting it become known to the purity aggression that would provoke deep into meditation beads on not just the idle speculations of ivory tower strategists they are the ideas toward which we did general approval of its allies several successive united states' administrations have been moving beginning with doctor james stashing your security fence under nixon and ford continuing under president carter with a much publicized presidential directive to fifty nine p. e. t. fifty nine and now under president reagan limited nuclear attacks with long range nuclear weapons upon sewerage foresees that even in soviet eritrea have become a recognized possible components of american

just over a year ago for instance he beachhead that statements about the next day to get and partial use of nuclear weapons hobnobbing in common with reality so what are we to make of it all i start from the belief that they cannot escape the question by the total abolition of nuclear weapons the problems of arms control and too extensive to discuss not in our return to the men might turn out in a lecture suffice it to say now that leaving aside the prospect of whatever more traditional forms of warfare might break out at the new pier in coral the problems of verification and control in pale the schemes have far reaching gaze ,comma much appear insurmountable assuming that the abandonment of full capacity to sell tickets will not appeal to the majority i'm left with the country that some element of knitted parents will remain a feature of the strategic sea if that's to be settled by hubbard is unjust to professional deformation of perception can tactics or excessive exposure to shuck the theory that makes me feel uneasy about the idea of having no ideas about the use of new q. baptist beyond threatening to kill as many people as possible because that is cheap and easy in all efforts to get hurt by the prospect of retaliate should i stick one must grapple with the continuum of threats the opposite poles of which i think alves plausibility and hire that is to set the path to choose between trying to deter by making lesser threats which by reason of being lessard arata credible or black eye during dire threats which dell implausible because of their will for consequences are for the very same reason quite daunting provided of course we have some known means of executing the so far other nuclear powers have exercised great coercion in confrontations with

efforts to improve the hub ,comma a new pier warts for lott enemies are afforded on one's own best to keep the cash went to audit turned up in terms of their own strategic assumptions by millet to doctor engine postures that are impressive by best at its now are frequent objection to preparations for fighting nuclear wars short of a simple orgy of mutual destruction is that they would be tarnished the arms race is true that the facile notion of overkill has arisen in the context of planning simply to kill and offended people cyclist racket g's dumont more careful analysis of the forces are part unreality of course even attacks on cities depend for certainty in a complex set of assumptions about her liability invulnerability of weapons and about a wide range of current cebu measures to minimize damage shifting the initial focus to more limited probably millet to targets need not breaking aggravate the problem here is for instance known eight to include any missiles into target plants open amid a nuclear strike in several good reasons not to do so particularly the need to avoid provoking paper said that the response on the well known strategists principal off if you're going to do it usage the more plausible strategies of limited nuclear war in disease and stargazers o. refinery's communications or conventional mitre installation target of this kind are up almost as finite justice studies in any case no more than a few could be attacked with much reasonable expectation of continued imitation modification of weapons is thus not a prerequisite for limited nuclear strategy is in there aren't any cases i argued last tie i'm many competing demands both military and civilian to limit the share of national resources devoted to nuclear weapons that once marked that the midwest are quite rare and leaves the modification of the concepts of new kidded carrots involves important issues that should be better understood and that the outcome of the debate will have a fundamental effect on the future but you see like waldner to deter strategies the idea of a limited nuclear options is intended not to fight a war but to deter aggression and thereby covered war nevertheless i do not pretend to read the excessive confidence in the hunt for one thing control would be far from easy it would be unthinkable to pretend that a limited nuclear war would be very limited by common sense that it's an assisting gould did much the weapon is distinct praised its attack on the back who oilfields in the caucasus tried to minimize casualties is estimated to entail two hundred thousand russian deaths and seven hundred fifty thousand injuries so the attack on the american land base missile force might hold casualties down to three hundred to two eight hundred thousand deaths although these numbers are much much lower than the tens of millions of deaths due to wordy stuart by strategies of assured destruction they are still a rustic moreover though no estimates are optimistic because there are so many uncertainties about the effects of new two weapons he scanned the area while the according to weapon performance weather season in the degree of protection enjoyed perhaps accidentally by the population the worst estimate from a tack on the american bishops' is around twenty million to some of the new period facts like connector magnetic poles may damage the very communications with which we hope the kennedy what exercises restraint so i can crush from all this that limited nuclear options or regret for a dangerous idea that two edged short indeed if such an option that is ever to come and get we should be in a desperate plight but that is a reason i don't believe such strategies make the world safe for nuclear war quite enough horror quite enough suffused fear of holocaust would survive to invoke a course she won the consequences of a failure to terrance might might be infinitely preferable to doesn't tale by assured destruction sites to the limited options as a few with added stopping places not too hopeful would very much need stopping place used on the dreadful as glittery slope the question remains with the soviet union played this game they usually say not but their interest that carson the reiterated assertion that war must be wielded doesn't disturb the policy of high value they place a survivor of soviet power all this gives him a strong incentive to keep the course of a war under control if it comes with a technical operators come on to control which that provided themselves suggest a strong determination to retain the discretion of the high cannot control strategies to avoid killing people is a matter of principle even though they may be killed in a britain that would also be as incompatible with e. d. might be great if acidity the body evolution of effective technical means arched gigi defects as the russians used to insist money spent on defensive weapons seems inherently preferable to that spent on prospects but you realize that one competes with the other with the defense budgets they do have limits are higher but should it i realized that the very idea of maintaining forces that could kill millions bisher park and on larocca morality is not read any quantified but must divest it to feel that had ever sold worse because of the six million returned six tech any strategy be justified that requires even a conditional readiness to kill or risk getting bread are numbers of people i do not break myself very highly as a moralist allot argue a with anyone who professes an aversion to any kind of warfare troll ago i had some doubts about the success of such people in ordering their whole life in a mad at hoary consistent with that principle in this however who won't go that far cuellar is something special about the potential destructiveness of nuclear war and cannot imagine any political purpose they could make recourse to a worthwhile set jaw or breaches the notion of proportionality that seems to pervade most breathtaking about justify ability in conflict to this i would reply with some trepidation that if i take what i believe to be a protestant christian view i don't expect to find it politically practical course of action that is without a degree it's sinful must canady tried to select the mideast and full of the course is open to the never forgetting however that it is not granted blemishes merely because it is the best that i can do that because nuclear weapons exist and cannot be intimidated at the great east the knowledge of how to make them can never be erased i don't believe that any policy can provide it absolute assurance that it will not need to nuclear war at the nineteen thirties illustrated even policies of millet treaty blacked and diplomatic self happening geisha can later be accused by history of complicity in coursing warps ultimately hyper leave we do not have the lecturing of choosing a policy polly untainted by the nuclear danger to decode a choose between policies they detail different degrees or risk can therefore see no absolute moral bar to the policies it should teach jake and political analyses need me to think have the best shots of the bridging catastrophe as far as i can see a policy of sustained is new to the carrots combined with efforts to extend responsible political control over military action but the four had coughed a war breaks out such a policy has a good shots as many strategies and better than most for preventing nuclear war in the meantime they can make the bistro contribution to preserving other western interests morrow i believe that the validity of this conception is not confined to the west and that combining the traditional logic of strategy in this way with the new and revolutionary technology produces prudent rules of general application i recognize a chorus that today's strategic sinking his time and talked about even if it is that it could not i do not doubt that technological and political change will dumond fresh strategic speculation and new security policies but without much surprise however if it ever comes to seem wise to observe such a sharp distinction between nuclear deterrence and the more traditional realms of strategy as the advocates of mutual assured destruction that attempted to do indeed as i tend to argue next week due to the test depends on much more than nuclear weapons on the problematic of those weapons to the infrastructure of millet treat and political power it then listening to it and tossed in it and i said to be the seed beat
