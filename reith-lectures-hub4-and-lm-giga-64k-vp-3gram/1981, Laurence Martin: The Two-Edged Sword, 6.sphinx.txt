prescriptions that we offer the dangerous overconfidence in one's own analysis is aggravating by surprising familiarity into superficial appearance of a contemporary strategic world if we got around

i would not oddity dismissed the significance of so many nations paying at the stud that service to peace and undertaking to renounce war the need to justify behavioral gangsters higher standard has a

peace and order has made it to settle deference to were politics third even parts of the international community where a much more radical transformation may have overtaken the classical state system somebody that is so called western or that the nations of calm to constitute a security community that is a group or state between home or has become unthinkable and who therefore no longer need to take security per course and against each other once again i don't think that this evolution busey connerly dimension or i do believe that canada is confident that she will not be invaded by the united states for instance is different and justifiably so from the face of tenant can rip rossini churlish and shipped to the soviet union that transformation are frank to gem international's from chronic and acute to intimate mutual collaboration is deservedly one of the wonders of recent diplomacy and yak ice here we should fuel even these achievements as merely proved a should all the costs it would be moderate goal more our expectations of rapid extending harmony of this kind elsewhere for i know few frenchman who don't believe that their national nuclear force is a source of confidence to them as they contemplate the writ aetna's resurgence of german power i even know very senior canadian officials who wish army that they worked on the hypothesis that if they did not free any offer millard chief facilities to the united states the americans would seize on it for crisis made that seem necessary but about all these particular doubts we must not overlook the fact that if hominy and corporations have blossomed when in the west during the postwar years that it does so in the classic conditions for such behavior the perception of a common external enemy i don't suggest that the

security problems for ground still less than can we assume that arnett rigid success is a model the rest of the world will follow that may be slow to gloomier view of the where old but i'm sure it is the best light we can throw on the east west rivalry that dominates the contemporary strategic sea i doubt whether one can have a relationship of trust with a power like the soviet union that combines abbas addicts dialectic will view of politics with our russian experience are fortunate to vulnerability and self aggrandizement the fact that we can negotiate with the soviet union reach mutually

harmonious purpose is to bar and of any power is far from coconuts the soviet union certainly doesn't want a major war the work i quoted a moment ago from riddick has that the fact that imperialism

unfortunately the alliance upon which the west relies to keep up its end of the balance is in one of its periodic mood spa of uncertainty differences over how to proceed and especially over what coda

going to let the strength of what i do feel that it's safe to do so because of soviet economic weakness this ever again obviously does put a value on trade and technological help is also well aware that such a line tends to reduce western support for ministry preparations for a flat refusal to try the approach would clearly divide the west and now that the reagan and at the station has resumed negotiations the policy of detente combined with dispensed is back in business we should not forget however that economic and political beings create vested interests on both sides while ministry

power to destroy the b. b. c.'s recent mori opinion poll revealed a course that only nine percent of the british public do favor leaving nato rather martel ever support policies against american bases for example that might well be incompatible with the coalition's survival for myself i would single out three policies that should not be abandoned without a great history section than nuclear force the contribution to the central front and capacity however modest to undertake action outside the north that backed p. d. gary suter to airforce is by far the most controversial of these with the devil to rat after arguments already exhausted petey beatty for my self -hyphen purse right to the argument that the existence of an ottoman centered decision independent of the united states capable of launching an attack on the soviet union if a nuclear war in europe began to get out of hand and to threaten british survival to the existence of such a capability is a powerful package due care and to soviet aggression and to the rest of the soviet union's massive fifty nuclear foresees its aggression did occur but took in for a useful role in the british nuclear force it's not necessary to

we must recognize however that for what they offer this to me you accept the rational and first place nuclear weapons are relatively cheap and it's trident is difficult to fit into the defense budget is largely because of the immensely cost the nature of the conventional forces if you believe in a national nuclear force and according to a mori opinion poll a majority fifty two percent of the

european defects and as the preceding argument suggests neither the british nor the american nuclear foresees makes sense without an underlying framework of conventional capability by thomas demanding task here is the maintenance of a substantial presence on the central front in europe but political almost symbolic reasons that this and not much less important than district eight strategic ration aha course there are urgent care and ground missions for british forces to perform and if we drawled big gap they would need would be hard to fill indeed is like a hit such a withdrawal would materially shorten defused a nuclear escalation but awestruck demilitarized rounds i have long believed a more rational division of labor would free britain to concentrate on the maritime role which no other allied you stuff you get to the far but lasted more coherent european defense community create the necessary mutual confidence to permit such a rational allocation of tasks including a full french participation i see it a case for a strong british presence to reassure west germany satisfied the nine states and display at the carriage unity to the soviet union is inescapable moreover even

increasingly less likely the more probable contingencies are high that the swift landon embattled needing to a quick soviet victory or a riposte to the soviet union at a peace negotiated under fear of nuclear escalation to recent defense review or reduced british naval forces but only to a moderate degree that it may well be that a much more effective navy could arise from the remains of the all used to be hoped that it does for a set a limit beyond which the sacrifice of maritime capability to the central front should not go one section and it is the preservation of a sufficient core of naval power and prestige for britain to pay its appropriate maritime park in any more integrated european defense of the future and other is the continued capacity modest or needs must be to take a handy millers to confrontations beyond the north atlantic treaty area britain's power demands such operations which are port by no means necessarily naval can only be slight but as i argued in an

are matters for judgment case by case but had no capacity to act preempt any such judgment to recent opinion poll suggested a majority of the british public would regret such a definitive contraction of british capability it is indeed to the matter of public opinion that i wish to devote the last few minutes of these matchups beak and image that is raging over strategy in the western alliance is
