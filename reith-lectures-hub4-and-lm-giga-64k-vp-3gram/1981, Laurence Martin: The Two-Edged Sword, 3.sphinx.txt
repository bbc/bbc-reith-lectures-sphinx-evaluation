is a terrifying thing to do with the kid that just as america does dangers are obvious and promote a great deal to sell it to caution it therefore seems much more likely that his new care war ever does break out between the major powers it will be the result of miscalculation and some local confrontation rather will bolt from the blue most because the strategic balance suddenly looks favorable to one side or the other stock trends for the limited the controlled use of strategic nuclear weapons if the kind i discussed last week may do something to read palms to detach effect of these weapons in such confrontations but chemistry main clumsy and dangerous instruments to make new gated terrence effective consequent to require the framework of more traditional millet chic advocate that can be more ready applied to specific strategic problems by far the most important potential are enough for such conflicts is europe where the interest of the superpowers are most purely to find and where the most powerful militia forces in history can be concentrated you can do to get charron says adopt final centerpiece of contemporary strategy europe its geopolitical focused i must admit the start that i would have discussed the european strategic seed when drama more confident a couple of years ago than i do today against intolerance of the rise of neutral restore unilaterally sentiment in western europe reminder is how the political elements of a millet to balance can change much more rapidly than the material the masa that big alliances exist today is a response to the final collapse in nineteen forty five of the self contained european balance of power off to the first world war that took a decade or more before the next two a danger to european security manifested itself so much so that they are a half was reduced to measuring itself against a wall with frogs in nineteen forty five with the red army west of berlin to was no room to doubt that if the data did exist that came out from the soviet union ,comma said that a treaty colina merrick and power to redress the european ballots it explains a lot of subsequent history to note that the treaty was signed today a probe nineteen forty nine that is before the soviet union had exploded a comic palm and before the united states decided that the thermonuclear weapon huge palm was feasible there is remarkably unanimity among were students or intelligence about what silly games in europe have beaten consistently since nineteen forty five first priority is to make discovered gemini covert eastern europe both for strategic reasons and because of its ideological significance pessimist averaged part of the socialist camp second comes to reduction of american power and presence in western europe and their placement by that of the soviet union itself exposure to the ice age is not to be pursued however in such a manner as to create a self reliant twisting europe especially not won under west germany to

red army crushes the polls may do will be back in the committee a situation is still a union may be that short of its lines of communication and fred time mideast unable to rely on help from the polish army nato may become somewhat more life in a nice millet to preparations for previous episodes hungary checks slovakia afghanistan do not suggest that the stimulus would be busting but is opposed to prevail and established their relative independence be buddies superficially be a considerable victory for the west to first rollback of soviet power in europe since the austrian peace

the powerlessness of the red army if this opinion he wrote each european contributions to nato or separate away mcmanus cubism in united states to belief that american troops in europe should be substantially reduced satcher reaction might well lose in the american commitment back prospects i would find highly alarming forty is far from certain that any soviet retreat would be permanent or that he would necessarily be so very fatal to still get mushy capability already polish trade unionists have understandably said princeton's that poland must continue to guaranteed the soviet union's rights called minot to access and transit so i conclude that the maintenance of the framework of western european defense would be just as necessary operate happy outcome for the polls has coughed up

know that any sudden unilateral disarmament wu or to create new political situations and new invitations to regression where none existed before omelets are important not just for what could be done with them in time of war but for a psychological shadows they cost in time of peace since nineteen forty five to chief shadow in europe has been passed by the red army the orthodox western view has been that nato cannot cope with the red army in a full scale conventional war for much of the first four years the red army has fielded much larger quantities to divisions weapons the nature of that nature has been a wood console itself with higher quality that would tie tomita bore you with whole much publicized evidence for believing that while the soviet quantitative adoptees has it that i

cruiser to the success of a modern invading force the warsaw pact of bondage over nato in the central front has risen from a superiority of sixteen thousand tanks to make just sixth last month in nineteen seventy two to a margin off twenty thousand to nine to seven thousand today at the same time the soviet union has reversed the traditional pattern in which each new technical sophistication has usually appeared first on the western side necessarily kunin introduced the sokol force generation tank that is the one off to the chieftain knack for generations before nato did indeed the soviet union produced two thousand five hundred of these new tanks in nineteen eighty and loved it already has more obvious generation deployed than nato plans to have by the mid eighties impression of great increased soviet millet seapower is kerry's filtering down to the wider public in a mori opinion poll commissioned by the b. b. c. on the occasion of these lectures no less than fifty four percent of the respondents believed that the soviet union was the world's strongest millet seapower compared to twenty five percent who believe that about united states set a late fifty five percent called the soviet union had more nuclear weapons than any other country in a tricky three percent taking that to be true of american of course even with its increased margin of superiority the soviet union cannot yet be certain of a quick and easy victory must therefore still feel the church from aggression how what comfort you derive from that whoever the bans on how you envisage the outbreak of the war in europe soviet militia doctrine does laid great stress on the latrine norms that is all theoretically established levels of force necessary for success in particular types of operations this is

materially inferior but strategically and tactic he bet on managed the crude material balance of men and machines takes effect in may through the mechanisms of millet trade and political skill and determination gehrig and is the phenomenon i referred to him and heard a lecture the instability of conventional energy balance is in a particular danger rising from the would be aggressor or who believes he has it all up half the device nature relies upon to replace is dangerous to pursue shipped with the care and certainty is the nuclear weapon for the last fifteen years the official doctrine foaming kenya to weapons to european security has been the so called flexible response employing the nato triad of conventional tactical nuclear astrid gigi nuclear weapons the first line of allied resistance to conventional attack is to be conventional resistance if that fails tactical nuclear weapons use on the battlefield are both to reinforce the defense and raise the specter of escalation finally cornell's fails weapons are to be employed more widely but ultimately strategically against the soviet union this farm in that reveals that nato's basic dynamo the fact that the most powerful nuclear forces in the west gone to the united states while it was like a battlefield belongs to a collection of the independent european allies to the united states has an interest in postponing the moment of strategic nuclear war which is the only kind that involves american carrot cake or any plans to prolong the new pier or even the congressional faces of war in europe may weaken soviet fears of escalation and we certainly devastate europe if implemented the divergence of interests israel biddy did i think the dangerous goal a certification could characterize it as some do as a european preference for the parents in american preference for defects everyone in nato wants to tear up its because any war with due to rapid about indeed any war told three powerful alliances would be a good fit a dangerous business the argument is about how to do to be tearing into current debates over theater nuclear weapons some year naturalists ably supported by several soviet research institutes suggest a positive american eagerness for a limited nuclear war confined to europe be obvious to honorable to surrounding such a war the vulnerability you're the immense american garrison and the countless american families in europe the obvious danger of escalation to the intercontinental levels however unintended all this makes it extremely difficult for me to understand why the united states should renew such risks but the alternative of abandoning europe to its fate seems much more attractive morrow right if europeans would naturally prefer successful attempts to war most of them by no means wanton assurance addicted parents fails the resulting war would immediately become nuclear and under strict u. admitted a few americans as well as europeans have advocated a policy of immediate recourse to nuclear weapons would be the most effective deterrent such strategies can range from the old idea of athena screener foresees acid trip wire to trigger a nuclear retaliation on soviet territory when he scored prompts to parents these days in the netherlands to the proposals for using so quoted many nukes solely on the battlefield as i'd jumped to conventional defense the truth is however that to be credible such policies would require virtually automatic action perhaps by prix delegated authority to ability to modest to use nuclear weapons years of alliance history have made it quite clear that no government european or american is willing to commit itself finally to the use of nuclear weapons and tunick concede the exact second statues in which the need arises consequent nato strategy does contain an inevitable element of uncertainty this provides endless opportunity for uneasiness and neutral or termination allied states but have done their best to make a virtue of this ambiguity that former british defense minister dock and sentenced once referred to an area in the tweed about which i will not speculate and which i will not be fined less elegantly but with equally accomplished all class station permission director of new care padding it major explained the net are doctrine for use of nuclear weapons is pierre concise simple and direct aid is that when required the alliance would respond with nuclear weapons on this scale appropriate to the circumstances in practice the right to a different kind of ambiguity in the strategy the official line is designed to keep the selby union uncertain about when and how do two weapons are to be used but not about whether they would be used in official aid many europeans are uncertain whether the united states would act to use nuclear weapons on their b. hoff that they hoped to get measured a smaller risk of using weapons on the battlefield with tents the united states at least pratfall are on to mr. priest nebraska nation and at that prospect will deter a soviet aggression in the first acts in the recent trend of the millet to balances breaking priestess strain on this creaking haynes in the alliance so its striking power against the united states authenticated and the soap treaties discredit the idea of an american retaliation at the strategic level buddy increased conventional power of the red army compels nature to rely as much as ever ,comma threat of escalation as options and therefore can find more than ever to package immediate level of nuclear action on the battlefield where it's at and teach one /slash eight it has therefore been unnatural and politically devastating move for the stoic union to turn to building up its capability at precisely this level of nuclear armament degrade bodi of this soviet effort is a notorious u. s. s. twenty como balm to south with multiple warheads or range of some five thousand kilometers over two hundred fifty of these missiles have been deployed since nineteen seventy six and a new one is now appearing every five dates as a result has been a fifty six percent increase in the number of hokey soviet warheads of distinct immediate range over the last twelve months is that a grave mistake i believe it's an understandable one for major to seize on e. s. s. twenty as a convenient excuse to justify refurbishing nader's own battlefield is yet to get the weapons when esrey concede the problem is really part of the overall b. k. of nato's relative capability at this and other levels of four fat yes this trendy is in fact buddy one part of a whole new family of soviet nuclear weapons and the european theater ranging from another miss seiler of over one thousand kilometers range down through shorter range missiles to new nuclear capable aircraft and introduction of soviet nuclear artillery detractors insurer that even if the so called zero option when negotiated at the level of the s. s. twenty cruise missile pershing true a great soviet nuclear capability would remain at wingate western europe's vulnerability with this much more effective accurate controllable array of weapons still begin in may believe that nato would not dare use his own battlefield weapons first because he would beat out ford and because nato's old kind of escalation to the tension level perhaps involving soviet parent tree is now on tenable because of the much improved soviet capability to fight at that level also all without involving the intercontinental weapons it is that's not the s. s. twenty that the overall strategic context with the which the theater in new pier balance has turned again to nato that constitutes the kenya and the new problem confronting the west but lacked houk in nato best deal with this problem i think we must recognize that that is no wholly satisfactory concert what's again we feel the other edge of the sort are former strategies have not been perfect and know their success is the disease and constable for residents of west junior is the price of living next door to an unpleasant superpower so long as there is a new pier soviet union western europe needs a new pew to tear up to insure the soviet union never comes to believe that they could use or threaten to use its nuclear weapons in europe with impunity this requires a recount entry nuclear capability able to track and attacks on soviet territory if the damaging europe ever reaches intolerable level at present there are three main sources of such potential retaliation first there are the national british and french nuclear force cheapest which reached their most plausible level of credibility on the assumption that british and french tara treaties already under attack second main problem limited strategic options of the nine states discussed my lecture last week and thirty eight there are attacks launched on the soviet union or on soviet forces in eastern europe by american nuclear weapons based in europe it is a course to reinforced last possibility that the current modernization program involving the cruise missile house and the pershing two has been proposed the idea that the threat of such attacks is more plausible if magic from european terror treat is well embedded in the strategic ejection primarily it is argued that credible threats of retaliation coal for a certain symmetry and appropriateness even issue like a certain legitimacy and that this would be observed by retaliation from the actual care tree under attack using u. o. a statue efforts would also reduce said sega's high to the enemy a desire to stop short of the ultimate stages its superpower conflict and a willingness to terminate the war if the immediate aggression in progress is halted for the big carrot defects may be extracted from a symbolic presence of these american weapons and european sorrel unaffected they would be over ron in a successful soviet invasion to selig and of course it nice that it would recognize any such distinction and asserts that it would retaliate directly on the united states keeps soviet eritrea were struck by had no doubt that this is possible and that the soviet union does think it unfair that it can be struck by a medium range american forces from europe while it can only get the united states with a long range systems covered by the stalled negotiations there before we are carried away with sympathy we should note the corolla rayovac buddy which is at the soviet union should be able to reign weapons on western europe with impunity to terrance is a matter painstakingly denying an enemy any option that offers him promise of success without disproportionate costs if nato had no ability to cut the soviet union in a war confined to europe it would leave just such a hole in its defects its i concluded that the modernization and strengthening kopp may just capability to fight to dust devil deserves support the specific proposal to introduce cruise missiles at pershing two however seems to me not to sell a central north are dangerous as the extreme advocates ahmad decided the current bitter controversy suggest what the team pork and is for europe to be seen to be working seriously antipoverty with the united states on reinforcing bisbee cute to be sent to deepening in transatlantic relations this yankees mediate assets twenty or not and it is the whole western in nuclear arsenals that needs review and refurbishment not mandate the few weapons embodied in the current controversial package american willingness to field systems in europe that can reach those who emits the disk to lead you to suggest would mark the onset of the inter continental war seems to me to be as far as united states can go into registering the cliques that dibella a deed of a substantial nuclear war confined to europe insofar as they believe what they say about escalation to still be adidas should be much to turn but just as we should not be mesmerized by the s. s. twenty two ignoring the wider significance of the theater nuclear balance we should not allow the nuclear questions to blind us to the other elements in the carrots is the fact that the soviet union caliph attacked western europe without getting into war with the united states that ties american nuclear power must firmly to european security moreover why his soviet nuclear power that compels major to maintain its own nuclear forces in europe is still good conventional superiority that compels nato to consider using a new k. weapons first do more credible nato's confessional capability the more plausible russia mouth of the presence of the american troops in the more postponed will become those divisive questions about the nature and timing of juppe action indeed if the soviet union is tempted to believe that nato might never again a ulysses nuclear weapons to more urgent the need to reduce soviet confidence in victory in a horny conventional war reluctance to redouble efforts at conventional defense arises partly from failure to recognize that as in the nuclear field well considered preparations makes the warp and for the best and not more

campaigns against the nato decision to modernize nuke your reference is a payment to a veto on western europe's efforts to manage its own affairs get in a minimal western capability for defects and a

western european political theme dependence on decision by reaching deeper into the domestic key european political debate about the fence the soviet union is groping its way toward what has been
