this is about cost and i said that b. b. c. to take tests to slay janice a. isn't my aim is the brains and signed skip them by tell sell with a wrist he broke his stick in nineteen eighty full the purpose of this lecture historic claim the structure of human actions or any to do that for several reasons i need to show how the nature of action is consistent with my kind of the mind body problem and my rejection of artificial intelligence both of which i discussed an earlier lectures i need to explain the mental component of action and show how it relates to the physical component i need to show how the structure of action relates to the explanation of action and i need to lay a foundation for the discussion of the nature of the social sciences and the possibility of the freedom of the whale both of which i'll discuss it my last two lectures i hope in the end of what i say will seem like a commonsense account of the structure of action if i'm right when i say should seem obviously right but as usual ,comma is that he's not simple in fact it is remarkably complicated and historically what i think of as the commonsense econometrics and has not seen got its for one thing the behaviorist tradition in philosophy and psychology has led many people to neglect them mental component of actions behavior is what i did a fine actions and india all of our mental life in terms of sheer physical movements somebody once characterized the behaviorist approach justifiably in my view as meaning anesthesia the opposite extreme and velocity has been thus say that the only acts we ever perform our inner mental axa volition and has few we'd all strictly speaking ever raise our arms all we do we as foliage that our arms go up if they do go up well and so much gridlock but not really our action and other problem is that until recently the philosophy of action was a somewhat neglected subject the western tradition has persistently emphasized knowing as more important than doling listeria knowledge and meaning has been more central to its concerns ben assyrian action i want now to try to draw together both mental and the physical aspects of action in such a way is to show both tough physical actions have a mental component and other mental component functions casale in producing the physical component if we think about human actions we immediately find some striking differences between them and other events in the natural world at first it's tempting to think that types of actions are behavior can be identified which types of bodily movements but that's obviously wrong for example one in the same set of human bodily movements might constitute a dance or signaling or exercising more testing one's muscles when none of the above furthermore just as won at the same set of types of physical movements can constitute completely different kinds of actions so one type of action can be performed by vastly different number of types of physical movements think free sample of sending a message to a friend you could ride it out on a sheet of paper you get tight that you get ended by messenger by telegram or you can speak it over the telephone and indeed each of these ways of sending the same message could be accomplished in a variety of physical movements you could write the note with your left hand or your right hand which your toes or even by holding a pencil between your teeth furthermore another hot feature about actions which makes them differ from advanced generally is that actions seem to have preferred descriptions if free sample i'm going for a walk to hyde park there again nino broke other things that are happening in the course of my walk but their descriptions do not describe my intentional action because he'd acting what i'm doing depends in large part on what i think god in doing so for example ,comma also moving in the general direction of patagonia shaking the hair on my head up and down in wearing out my shoes and moving a lot of air molecules however not levies other descriptions screens to get at what is essential about this action is third related feature of actions is that a person is at a special position to know what he's doing he doesn't have to observe himself were conduct an investigation to see which actions he's performing or at least trying to perform so que se enemy are you try to walk died park or try to get closer to patagonia i have no hesitation in giving an answer even though the physical moments that i make might be appropriate for either answer its also a remarkable fact about human beings that quite effortlessly word able to ride edifying explain the behavior of ourselves and of other people i believe that this ability rests on an unconscious mastery of a certain set of principles just as our ability to recognize something is a sense of english rests on our having an unconscious mastery of the principles of english grammar i believe there are a set of principles that we priests oppose leumi say such ordinary common sense things as that for example basil ordered for the tories because he thought they would cure the problem of inflation or sally moved from birmingham to london because she thought the job opportunities were better there or even such simple things that backed the man over there making such strange movement is in fact sharpening and acts or polishing his shoe is quite common for people who recognize the existence of these theoretical principles to sneer at them by saying that they're just a folk theory and that they should be supplanted by some more scientific account of human behavior i am suspicious of this claim just as i would be suspicious of acclaim that said we should supplant are implicit theory of english grammar and the one we acquired by learning the language and the reason for my suspicion in each case is the same using the implicit theory is part of performing the actions in the same way that you sing the roles of grammar is part of speaking so well we might add to it or discover all sorts of interesting additional things about language or about behavior it's very unlikely that we could rip placed at theory which is implicit in partly constitute about the phenomenon by some external scientific account of the mac very phenomena aristotle and descartes would've been completely familiar with most of our explanations of human behavior but not with our explanations of biological and physical phenomena to resign usually given for the skis that aristotle and descartes had bol top primitive theory of biology and physics ,comma while a hand cannot primitive theory of human behavior on the other and that while we begged bandstand biology and physics we've made no comparable advance in the exploration of human behavior i want to suggest an alternative view i think that aristotle and a car like ourselves already had a sophisticated and complex theory of human behavior i also think that many supposedly scientific accounts of behaviors such as freud's for example in fact employ it rather than are placed at principles of our implicit theory of human behavior to summarize then what i said so far there's more to types of actions than physical movements actions have preferred descriptions people know what they're doing without observation and the principles by which we identify and explain action by themselves part of the actions that is their partly constituted of actions i now want to give a brief account of what we might call the structure of human behavior in audit to explain the structure of behavior i need to introduce one art or to technical terms that keno should in the structure behavior is the notion of the intention now in the to say that mental state has intention audi simply means that it is about something for example a belief is always a belief that such and such is the case or desire is always a desire that such and such should happen or be the case intending any ordinary sense has no special role in the theory that tension audi intending to do something is just one kind of intentionally along with believing desiring hoping fearing annul arrest unintentional state like a bully for desire or any tension in the ordinary sense characteristically has two components it has what we might call its content which makes him about something and it's psychological mode or tight now the reason we need this distinction is that you can have the same content in different types so free sample icon want to leave the room might intend to leave the room and i can't believe that i will leave the rome in each case we have the same county at that i will leave the rome but in different psychological molds or types believe desire intending respectively furthermore the content of that type of state will serve to relate the mental state the world that after all is why we have minds with mental states to represent the world to ourselves to represent how it is how we delighted to be how we fear it may turn out what we intend to do about it and so on doubt this has the consequence that our police will be true if they match the way the world is false if they don't our desires will be fulfilled or frustrated our intentions carry out were not carried out in general and intentional states have what we might call conditions of satisfaction each state gets self determines under what conditions it's true that say it's a belief or under what conditions it fulfilled its say it's the desire and under what conditions it's carried out if for example its intentions in each case with a mental state represents its own conditions of satisfaction a third feature to notice a about such states is that sometimes they cause things to happen three sample if i wanna go to the movies and i do go to the movies that normally might desire will cause the very event that it represents my going to the movies in such cases there is an internal connection between a clause in the effect because the clauses are representation of the very state of affairs that it causes because both are represented and brings about the effect i called such kinds of costs affect relations cases up intentional causation intentional causation as we will see will prove crucial both to the structure and to the exploration of human action is in various ways quite different from the standard textbook accounts of causation where for example one billiard ball hits another billiard ball and causes it to move for our purposes the essential thing about intentional causation is that in such cases come my into brings about the very state of affairs that it has been thanking about to summarize this discussion of intentionally thar three features that we need to keep in mind in our analysis of human behavior first intentional states consist of a content in a certain mental type second they determine their conditions of satisfaction that he is no be satisfied or not depending on whether the world matches the content of the state and third sometimes they call us things that happened by way of intentional causation to bring about a match that is to bring about the state of affairs they represent at what they represent brother vary state of affairs that have to happen for them to be satisfied their own conditions of satisfaction using these ideas are now turned to the main task of this lecture i promised to give a very brief account of what might be called the structure of action of the structure or behavior by behavior here i mean voluntary intentional human behavior i mean such things as walking or running eating making love voting in elections getting married buying and selling going on a vacation working out a job i'd don't mean such things as digesting growing older or snoring that even restricting ourselves to intentional behavior human activities presented is with a bewildering variety of types we need to distinguish between individual behavior and social behavior that twin collective social behavior of any individual behavior within a social collective between doing something for the sega something else and doing something for its own sake pratt's most difficult of all we need to account for the melodic sequences of behavior through the passage of time human activities after all and not like a series of still snapshots but something more like the movie of our life i obviously can't try to answer all of these questions in his lecture but i can give you a sketch of the basic structure of action at account of the structure beggar can be best given by stating a set of principles these principles should explain both a mental and physical aspects of action and presenting them i won't be discussing where our beliefs and desires in song ,comma from but i will be explaining how they figure out our behavior i think the simplest way to convey these principles is justice state them and then try to defend them so your guy was principal number one action is characteristically consist of two components are metal component kenneth physical component thanks for example both pushing a car on the one and are certain conscious experience has left africa new push if the successful those experiences will result in the movement of your body and a corresponding movement of the car if you are unsuccessful you will still attend the least them mental component that is you will still have had an experience of trying to move the car with at least some of the physical components there will have been muscles tightening is the feeling of pressure against the car and sought and this leads to principle number two thumb mental component used any intention he has the intention audi is about something it determines what counts is success or failure in the action any success spoke it causes the bodily movement which in turn causes the other movements such as the movement of a car which constitute the rest of the action in terms of the theory of intention audi that we just gets the action consists of two components in metal component and a physical component is successful the mental component clauses that physical component and represents the physical component this form of causation i'd just called intentional causation the best way to see them make sure the different components of an action is to carve each one often examined separately and in fact in a laboratory it's easy enough to do that we already have enderle physiology experiments done by wilder penfield of montreal whereby it electrically stimulating a certain portion of the patients motor cortex enfield could climb the movement of a patient's whims allocations were invariably surprised at this end they characteristically said that such things as i didn't do that you would get it in such a case we carved off the bodily movement without the intention noticed that in such cases the bodily movements might be exactly the same as they are deemed an intentional action but it seems quite clear that there's a difference well what is the difference we also have experiments going back as far as william james where we can carve off a metal component without the corresponding physical component of the action in the williams amos case but patients harmonies and mess that guys and it is held at a site in a dark room and he is then ordered to raise its key does what he thinks is the bane reorder but is later quite surprised to discover that his arm didn't go out now and that case we carve off the metal component that is to say the intention from the bottling moment for the man really did have the intention days we can truly say up to him he genuinely did try to move is not in an r. o. case these two components come together we usually have both the intention and the bodily movement but they're not independent but our first two principals try to articulate is how they are related them metal component that's part of its conditions of satisfaction at the boat to represent and caused the physical component lights turned out to principled number three that kind of call as nation which is essential both to the structure of action and the explanation of action is intentional causation de battling moments in our actions are caused by our intentions intentions are causal because they make things happen but they also have contents and so can figure in the process of logical reasoning they can be both caso and have these logical features because the kind of causation that we're talking about his mental causation or intentional causation and akin to intentional causation metal content affect the world the whole apparatus works because it's realized in the brain in a way that i explained in the first lecture before of causation that we're discussing here is really quite different from the standard form of causation as described in philosophical text books it's not a matter of regularity is recovering laws are constant injunctions in fact i think it's much closer to our common sense notion of causation where we just mean that something make something else happened what is special about an intentional causation is that it is a case of a mental state making something else happened and that's something else is the very state of affairs represented by the mental state that causes it principle number four in the theory of action there is a fundamental distinction between those actions which are premeditated which are the result of some kind of planning in advance and those actions which are spontaneous or we do something without any prior reflection and corresponding to this distinction we need a distinction between prior intentions betty's intentions form prior to the performance of an action ended intentions inaction which are the intentions we have well were actually performing inaction are common mistake in the syrian action is to suppose that ploy intentional actions are the result of some sort of deliberation that they're the product of a chain of practical reasoning that is when many things we do are not like that we simply do something without any prior reflection present when normal conversation one doesn't reflect on what one is going to say next one just as it in such cases there is indeed an intention but it's not an intentional form prior to the performance of the action is what i call any intention in action in other cases however we don't form prior intentions we reflect on what we want and what's the best way to achieve it this process of reflection aristotle called a practical reasoning by the way characteristically results in there and the formation of a prior intentions or as aristotle also pointed out sometimes it results in the action its self principal armor fire the formation of prior intentions he is at least generally the result of practical reasoning and practical reasoning is always reasoning about how best to decide between conflicting desires that are a force behind most human and animal action is desire always functioned only to enable us to figure out how best to satisfy our desires so free sample suppose i wanna go to paris and i believe that the best way all things considered is to go by plank i then form the intention to go by plane now that's a typical and commonsense piece of practical reasoning but practical reasoning differs crucially from theoretical reasoning from reasoning about what is the case in the practical reasoning is always about how best to decide among various conflicting desires that we have in a way that theoretical reasoning is not characteristically about how to decide between conflicting beliefs so for example supposed to do what i go to paris and i figure that the best ways to go by playing stale is no way i can do that without frustrating a large number of other desires that i have i don't wanna spend the money i don't wanna standing queues at airports by donors in an airplane seats i don't want the airplane food i don't want people put their elbow where i'm trying to put my elbow and so on indefinitely nonetheless in spite of all the desires that will be frustrated if i go to paris by plane that i may still reason that it's best or things considered to go to paris by playing this is not only technical effected a restrained but i think it's universal and practical reasoning that practical reasoning concerns the adjudication of conflicting desires well the picture that emerges from these five principal stand is that the mental energy that powers actions is an energy that works by intentional causation it's a form of energy whereby that cause either in the form of desires or intentions represents the very state of affairs that causes ballots go back to some of those points about action but i made at the beginning because i think we've assembled enough pieces to explain them we noticed that actions have preferred descriptions and that infect commonsense enabled us to identify what the preferred descriptions of actions work or not we concede that their preferred description of an action is determined by the attention and action what that person is really doling release what he's trying to do is entirely a matter of what the intention is that he is acting with free samples i know that i'm trying to get the hyde park and not try to get closer to patagonia because that's the intention with which i'm going for a walk this furthermore explains some of the logical features about the explanation is that we give a human action to explain and action is begin its causes its causes are psychological states those states who relate to the action either by being stepson into practical reasoning battle led to the intentions or by being the intentions themselves the most important feature of the explanation of action however is worth statement as a separate principal so let's call it principle number six pete explanation of inaction must have the same content as was in a person's head when he performed the action or when he resumed toward his intention to perform the action the content that clauses back a nearby wave intentional causation mosque be identical with the content in explanation of the behavior not disrespect actions differ from other natural events in the world and correspondingly their explorations differ when a waste when an earthquake or hurricane that content in the explanation only has to represent what happened and why it happened he doesn't actually have to cause the event itself but in explaining human behavior that cars can be explanation both have contents and the explanation hallway explains because it has the same content as the cause was off our we may talk as if people just bad intentions at a below but of course that's very unrealistic and we need now to introduce some complexities which will get our analysis at least a bit closer to the f. there's a real life no one ever just has an intention just like that by itself present both of those i have an intention to drive doctorate from london i might have that quite spontaneously nonetheless ,comma still have a series of other intentional states i must have a belief that i have a car and a belief that oxford is within driving distance furthermore iwo characteristically avid desire that the roads will be too crowded and a wish that the weather won't be too bad for driving also and here we get a little closer to the notion of the explanation in action iwo characteristically not just drive docks are but dry docks or for some purpose and it so i will characteristically in gauge impractical reasoning that former reasoning that leads not to believes our conclusions of arguments that the actual behavior and what we understand this former reasoning we will have made a great step toward understanding the exploration of actions that callie other intentional states that give the original intentional state the particular meaning that it has its call all of them than network of intention allen eight and we can say by way of a general conclusion let's call this principle number sap and any intentional state only functions as part of a network up other intentional states and by functions here i mean that it only determines its conditions of satisfaction relative to a whole lot of other intentional states now when we began to probe the details of the network we discover another interesting phenomenon and that is simply that the activities of our mind can not consist in mental states so to speak right down to the ground rather our mental states only function in the way they do because they function against a background of capacities abilities skills habits wheeze of doing things and general stances toward the world that do not themselves consist unintentional states in order for me so much as to form the intention to dry dock stirred i have to have the ability to drive but the ability to drive doesn't get soft insisted a whole lot of other intentional state it takes more than a bunch of beliefs and desires and so on in order to be able to drive i actually have to have the skill to dole it this is the case were my knowing how it is not just a matter of knowing that outlets called a set of skills habits abilities and so on against which intentional states function of background of intention audi and to the thesis of the network mainly the thesis that any intentional state only functions as a part of a network missed at the thesis of the background :colon principle number eight vauxhall network amid tension audi only functions against a background of human capacities that are not themselves mental states i said that many supposedly scientific accounts of behavior try to escape from our surpassed this commonsense model what i'd been sketching but in the end there's no way i think they can do that because these principles don't just described the phenomenon they themselves partly go to make up the phenomena consider free sample freud and explanations when freud is doing his mass psychology that is twenties getting is a theory of what he's doing he often uses scientific comparison there are a lot of analogies between psychology on the one hand an electromagnetic is among hydraulics on the other hand were to think of the mind as functioning on the analogy of some sort of hydraulic principles but twenties actually examining a patient and actually describing the nature of some patients are assessed is surprising how much the explanations he gives our commonsense explanations so dora made the way she does because example she's in love with hair k. or because she's imitating her cousin whose gough demaria itself now what freud and the common sense is the observation that lost in the mental states that cars are behavior are unconscious indeed there are pressed where often are resistant to admitting to having certain intentional states because we're ashamed of them are for some other reason and sank only freud also adds a theory of the transformations of mental states how one sort of intentional state can be transformed into another but with the addition of these and other such hair creations about freud and form an explanation he is very much the same as the commonsense farm and i suggest that common sense is likely to persist even as we acquire other more scientific accounts of behavior since the structure of the explanation haskell matched the structure of the phenomena explained improvements in exclamation and not likely to have knew what an unheard of structures in this lecture i try to explain how and in what sense behavior both campaigns and is caused by internal mental states it may seem surprising that many psychologists and cognitive scientists have tried to deny these relations the reasons for this to rise from a certain conception mayhem of science base in the best scientific account of human behavior should not be founded on a commonsense conception of mental states they think in my view incorrectly that assigned to the account of human bader cannot be based on such subjective mental phenomena as beliefs desires hopes speeders and so on i have argued that an account of action must be based on these phenomena if it is to succeed it then listening to a clubhouse condit and i. a. said the b. b. c. at least a chance to mold outposts keys that fit the b. c. don't kid o. t. k. /slash t. is full
