confrontation is to stabilize the blocks around the superpowers in the developed world has no parallel in the third or consequently there has been free rein to the many specific third world conflicts that arise from front to disputes from the nervousness of unstable regimes about the domestic rivals harbored by the neighbors as of economic need or from unevenly distributed economic resources the state of war in the third world is not usually large in the most common forms are priests intermittent and sometimes covert in the mideast however added the dukakis donnie complex a great deal of

there is an understandable temptation in the western democracies to stick to air the compact to third world and area celebrations of the system's especially at the time when the sparks of distant and

industrial output the power to create such interruptions therefore becomes a full edible political weapon and questionable supply must consequently become a consideration if sometimes unspoken in any future confrontations between the west and the soviet union as well as more obviously in crises in the middle east itself or depart however the preservation of a world order opened to trade on a

among the isolated so cord pariah states like south africa by one south korea handed to rescind the iraq is generally assumed that the spread of nuclear weapons is a bad thing intense spoke i agree that the view is not universal the french general pierre gano optimize vociferous veteran proponent of the french nuclear force is often taken as intellectual leader of those who believe that the

increased numbers of nuclear power as an increased danger as a great deal of who gets nuclear weapons when and how a nuclear force could be a stabilizing factor in the butt of the ballots i doubt if all my listeners would ignore the news if they had confirmed that israel does have a new ticket ability and that the arabs believe that nevertheless did get told a news report expiration are set action i think the burden of proof is on anyone who wants a drink or two new power to join the new pier acts and i believe that for the the nonproliferation policy is watched so how could such a

incentives and disincentives to require a military capability on many christie each peyser wrote doesn't incentive and expense as a disincentive for the most powerful considerations naturally arise from the strategic balance itself fast if the great powers of the developed world are to discourage nuclear proliferated in the third world they would have to play a role in the security affairs of

somalia the pledge to reduce their own nuclear armament put on the nonproliferation treaty is a price for getting the nonnuclear powers to accept such an inherently discriminatory contract may be counterproductive for only a powerful and self confidence superpower could princeton's serve as the guarantor to relieve israel of the need to plan its own nuclear deterrent begin civic intervention or rehash are egypt and israel against each other's nuclear potential the british race an issue brings me back to where i started this act to the fact that armed conflict is endemic in the third world

interpretation is an indication of sever its intentions because it is both in the third world and contiguous to the soviet border nevertheless it doesn't seem unduly alarmist to conclude that where practicable soviet forces may henceforth be used to erect the to prevent a reversal of the successes of soviet inspired regimes in the third where as a have repeated the beans in eastern europe into

for power projection passages cold will not disappear nor could the third world countries be treated as mere objects of policy now that they have tasted autonomy acquired a great deal of energy power and demonstrate to comedies to capitalist alike the cost of taking on an afro ration guerrilla war this suggests to me that the underlying idea of the post did not american strategy of operating as much as possible through the local structures of power with sound is inadequate by itself here and there are signs of regional stabilize asian are appearing in the third world through the emergence of a preeminent regional power like nigeria or brazil or critics may say like iran there are also embryonic regional organizations such as the organizing shun for african unity or the association of south east asian nations which embody a useful idea of mutual restraint in the west to be trudge which professed ideal of national independence that would encourage such developments to get its way to do so in both political and economic terms used by diplomatic and economic action rather than military that when cuba and libya and had even soviet forces can be called in to effect the issues

protect the gains of prior political answer prison action quick decision and rapid action is there for at least it is valuable as cruel to fight the power this is a field where much modern technology can ease the deputies of the decision maker providing to the very idea of intervention is not enough ,comma to domestic public opinion in this respect it may be interesting to note that his failure rather than effort that seems to have course to shop his opposition in western societies to one area where the west does not change or to just a good thought accused is the first golf when its stock stakes at royal and geopolitics geopolitics may indeed be more important in the long run in the game of mutual encirclement which the soviet chinese american contest involves here at the marriott of security problems typical of the third world is compounded by the real possibility of a massive invasion by the soviet union obviously the ultimate millet treated tear into this can only be provided by the united states many of the strategic considerations will be well but you from the extensive public debate that perhaps i could illustrate the american logistic problems may by pointing out that tehran is s. pushed adopted as it is to the new and our american base at diego garcia in the indian ocean nevertheless the task is far from pope purpose the more imminent dangers arise from local and arrest the disease as amenable to limited measures of economic and military systems as in any other region while sobriquet ability for all i. d. stressed poured the region is thought to superior it's tossed would by no means big easy march to the point it's highly unlikely that the soviet union who wants an all out war in the region and the cost therefore becomes one of creating a sufficient a plausible western presence to make such a prospect like this tossed brings me back finally to the american request to western europe and japan reconsider their montreal's tension from third world effects america's allies are understandably nervous they fear the costs of a millet euro cost that would be both economic military and it is still a union took reprisals had best expensive in terms of the so called dividends of detente in europe and at worst raising the danger of a coptic spreading to europe itself many europeans also got to the appropriateness of american prescriptions for the third were the clink of hope and belief that military intervention is not the necessary nor efficacious nevertheless europe doesn't have to be involved not merely because the stakes particularly loyal affected that because in a european nightmare that has been her current ever since the korean war to force is that the united states needs elsewhere may be bled from its european garrison and never will europeans missed those forces more than if some third world crisis both drove them away and raises the tension semel tasty in europe itself that anyone who makes this problem with a plea for return to the good old days of major allied solidarity is again imagining the cost conflict these dips too is has traditionally abroad have the worst in the lives that americans do not sing european colonialism and europeans condemning american militarists remember the suez crisis itself if we itemize to the problem today into the future the nice thing besides rocky udall is sir long as the europeans and the japanese that knowledge to the problem exists to choice lies between the added effect created by united allied action sharing the risks in the political costs in the benefits of allies acting separately each exporting its own special contacts and mission chips the fact that much of the most effective action called for his political and economic boris millet treat at the lower level all this makes the case for continued independence of action set no may the united states needs the powerful european and japanese economies mobilized to sustained friendly regimes in the third work but when it comes to military action the newfound reach off soviet foresees could only be convincing to offset by the united states and in a section umbrella however it may be that this molded experienced forces of britain and france can continue to do useful work somewhat surprising made in the b. b. c. mori opinion poll device cited last week no less than fifty five percent of the respondents were willing to see britain prayer millet tree road in the middle east again if british interests were threatened while on a twenty nine percent were opposed dosing favoring to the dome

a worldwide economic and political power on a grand scale without any matching military capability this is a question to which i do not expect u. recounts because however the contemporary east west
