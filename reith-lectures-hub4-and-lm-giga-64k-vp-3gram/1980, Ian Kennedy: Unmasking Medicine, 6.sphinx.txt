relationship with patients race from trust and indian launch to be trusted it to also carry out of line with the political tender today consumerism is witnessed the doctor has the choice is only if accepting it willingly and cooperating or accepting it and willing the most contentious approach to furthering the interests of patients is privately to geisha suing doctors or hospital administration or other stumbled in the cocaine even the mention of this raises the hackles of the medical profession you can give the prettiest forming nothing could be more damaging to the future medical care than the suggestion of patients to the doctors that if you accept that the current freedom of the patients are in need of protection you already seen that existing ways of achieving this protection noticed an outstanding success it's still held in the form of litigation may then weren't careful consideration my view is that he does have some role to play the role of the limit to what in establishing

doctors and lawyers here seem to do light to ridiculing it then preaching strode a games in a movement toward six to rid u. two is in my view unwarranted bubble would lodge the of the sort of chauvinist and lofty terrence which the english who developed into a hot rock for of course there are a total of unjustified dickey geisha of unscrupulous patience and lawyers bendix to see who would do damage to the peace of the egyptian production of informed consent as it is now operated in united states doesn't stop the court has already described in the years when misunderstanding comes in the courts have expanded to dock patients suffering unexpected calm have sued did doctors and being successful even in circumstances where in the view of west to doctors hadn't been at full with a

were to meet other cost when no one else to look to the best source of money is insurance carry bar to talk to the patient has made some small contribution to this when he paid his feet to the dock and is told it's not the doctor who played excision surer the doctor will basile accosted his insurance premiums by spreading it among his patients in the fees he collects to get this money has a the patient must suited up to a good doctor respite from blob pending holding him lovell it appears the court is saying he did something wrong he failed to obtain informed consent in truce accord is merely ensuring that some form of social welfare system operates paid up by insurance unfunded impatient each its varied in the fission system financially because it has to carry the costs of litigation that is the best the court can do to cool it has to do it by this like defended judging doctors to be in full to the deaf allowable to liberation that should have been more of a stiff to

to go so far to indoor open late liability without full perhaps they fear that if they are less alarmist the tough lobby of the medical establishment might persuade the legislature is to take action to limit by statute that power machinery this system inadequate health care free of charge and adequate welfare system would of course all create the need for this form of consumers and battista says device for compensating patients who suffered from putting united states that don't exist in united kingdom on the other hand there is still a social ill if the system and free health care at least for the moment which can serve as the basic source of funds for patients who complained of heart so that all this to this need for this form of consumers' dickey geisha in show ,comma in the united states in which money is the sole objective of the other hand it may be that litigation or the threat of litigation is needed to win the protection of the principal the patient still determination is the object of his role given the medical profession's reluctance to discipline its members that the issue could well provide the necessary sanction to ensure the proper standards group that i would regard it as a bad thing if more los sutro brought against doctors or hospitals in tradable cases to which a patient in a mental hospital was treating without consent in dissuade total would come to the age of the inarticulate to help boost who otherwise may remain a date to them to go equally wouldn't be a bad thing in a case in which the full implications of the dig to afford treatment would not explain to the patient will discuss the new israeli touched all the patients crops such action would in my view lead to a healthy respect for the patients' interests than the present seems to be seized and it would tend to insure the standards of practice were established which met the approval of outsiders and would adhere to an even more widespread fourth can chew litigation in united states is the action could make the troops the patient claims that he suffered heart because of the failure of the doctor or hospital to be haven away which could reasonably have been expected to poll

which success in the lawsuit would bring once again the english patient meeting for the karel disabled in any way can look initially to the health service and social security is american counterpart can expect rates to must get the money he needs to be informal and expensive social security system but the doctors' insurance despite publicity to the contrary the sums awarded to the united states

hussain hit the goal of compensating employees deemed socially desirable to wield recently is that if doctors would allow book it would be their insurance which would lead to cost but the insurance premiums paid by doctors in united kingdom are insufficient to meet such claims on the scale nor good doctors easily pay increase premiums since with a national health service they couldn't toss on a
